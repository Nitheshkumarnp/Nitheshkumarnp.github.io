        <pre>Assortment Functional KT:
	Top Down approach, After Macrospace is done, Assortment planning will start.
	In Macrospace: stores, departments, categories, min space, max space and recommended space are planned.
	Based on Available planogram, 1ft, 2ft, 3ft, ... possible allocation will happen.
	Ex. if recommended space is 9ft planogram, then possible allocation are 1*9ft, 2*4ft, 3*3ft, ...
	If the approach is Bottom Up, then Assortment is first, then Macrospace will happen.
	SKU(Stock Keeping Unit), we need to consider the all the SKU available in all over the stores, not in one store.
	Then plan based on particular size planogram and their possible combinations.
	We need SKU details like height, width and depth.
	Also the fixture where SKU are going to place like shelf, bar, pegboard,.. etc.
	Based on past/historical data, SKU performance will be monitored like no of sales, margin, days and also
	  space allocation to the SKU also taken into account to anaylize further.
	In Assortment, 
	  min facing, it should be given by customer, we should have to follow that also.
	  exact facing, it should be given by customer, we should have to keep the exact facing quantity.
	  preserve facing, it should be same as previous facing quantity, we should have to keep the same as before.
	  one way complementary list, if SKU A is listed, then SKU B also listed.
	  one way complementary delist, if SKU A is listed, then SKU B is delisted.
	  dependency list and dependency delist
	Demand Transfer:
	  If the expected item is not present in store, then customer go for similar item. Eg. Pepsi -> 7up
	  
	Explaination of Assortment in Excel with (store, category, planogram, week, sku, facing) and (sku, week, 
		sales, margin, units, cluster, chain).
	Explained the Parameter Used in Assortment optimization.
	Assortment Algorithm Flow:
	  Input Data:
		1) Mandatory files:
			Cluster Planogram input sheet
			Parameter fixtures
			Parameter sheet
		2) Non-Mandatory files:
			Demand Transfer percent(%)
			SKU details
			Customer Metrics Data
			Group Data
			Group Rules files
		3) Data Processing:
			Cluster POG level performance with selected store and active SKU list.
			
	Intelligent Replishment:
	  Removing item based on specific date from the store by markdown or other reasons.
	Legal size break means rounding the min and max value to based on the value mention as (LSB).
	Buddy is new term used which means if we don't have relevant info about the item, then we look for
	  similar item which perform same as the item and find the percentage of similarity to give recommendation.
	Cummulative variance:
	  In PCA, multiple columns are there in dataset, each column has importance %. Sorted on Descending order.
		if cummulative variance is 80%, then columns will be added till the sum of columns which give 80%.
	Minimum Proportion variance:
	  In cummulative variance, it accept n no of columns till the satisfy the given %. But it will take any column%.
		Here, if the minimum proportion variance is 25%, then columns which having more than 25% will be selected.
	Mahalanobis need to google it to understand.
	VARIMAX in PCA need to google it to understand.
	cooks distance calculation need to understand.
	stepwise regression need to understand.
	optimization engine working functionality explained in iteration manner.
