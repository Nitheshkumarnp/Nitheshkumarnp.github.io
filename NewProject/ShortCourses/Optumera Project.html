        <pre>Project - Optimera:
  Overview:
    TCS's AI powered retail optimization suite.
    Some of the global key trends dominating the global retail industry:
      Empathetic pricing
      Larger investment on supply chain
      Customer centric diversification of product mix across channels
      Embracing sustainability goals across the value chain
      
      Empathetic Pricing:
        Make more attention of global retailer while preserving margin.
        These initiatives are supported by the new age AI techniques 
          available with the industry.
        Whether the strategy is localized pricing, dynamic pricing or 
          promotions driven pricing, retailers need to establish empathy with 
          customers and account for customer behavior in all their pricing 
          decisions.
      
      Larger investment on supply chain:
        To make faster delivery and intelligent sourcing.
        However, with changing times and development in science, retailers 
          are looking forward to accelerated adoption of intelligence in 
          supply chain functions.
          
      Customer centric diversification of product mix across channels:
        Be it local sourcing, sustainable assortment, or deeper localization - retailers 
          are seeking intelligent options to connect with every consumer, and penetrate 
          with customer centric assortments.
        
      Embracing sustainability goals across the value chain:
        Everything they do today, revolves around the pledge to make businesses more 
          sustainable. There have been significant investments made in the recent past, 
          and pledged for the near future, to drive sustainability in business.
        
    Retailers are exploring innovative approaches to strike a balance in a multitude of 
      challenges around Customer, Environment and Business. Aligned to these themes, 
      organizations are committed to seek newer avenues to infuse science with the art of 
      doing business.
      
    Using Algo retail, the retailer business can be observed from a very different 
    	perspective. Traditionally, retailers did not have the right mechanism and means 
    	to generate insights, out of the data they had at their disposal. 
    	
    Algo retail is creating a fundamental shift in how retailers use the data and do business. Algo 
    	retail is TCS’ strategy and framework that explains how TCS is looking at the whole 
    	retail business algorithmically. With the inclusion of some of the advanced AI 
    	algorithms, Algo Retail improvises the decision-making piece of merchants and executives. 
    
    In this process, we help retailers unlock exponential value, and enable them to drive 
    	sales and profitability. 
    
    We are on a mission to make business Algorithmic, and Opt-umera 
    	is conceptualized on these lines. TCS Opt-umera helps to transform organizations into 
    	resilient, adaptable and nimble algorithmic enterprises, by seamlessly orchestrating data 
    	and algorithms across the value chain, and re-imagining processes with automation and intelligence.
    
    TCS Opt-umera is an AI-powered strategic intelligence platform, that infuses intelligence in 
    	every step of the retail value chain. Starting from space, assortment, pricing, promotions and 
    	optimization, to supply chain, in an integrated manner, solving over 50 use cases.
    	
    Few key use cases of TCS Opt-umera platform:
      Macrospace Optimization,
      Assortment Optimization,
      Price Optimization,
      Promotion Optimization,
      Markdown Optimization,
      Inventory management module: 
        Intelligent replenishment,
        Dynamic parameter tuning.
      
    Case Studies done by Opt-umera:
      One of the biggest General Merchandise retailers in US, we helped them to achieve a 
        sales uplift of 130 basepoints, and reduced time-to-market from 6 months to 3 months. 
        We enhanced their ability to do 5 times more strategies with space optimization.
      Pet retailer in US, through the implementation of integrated space and assortment 
        optimization, we helped them realize 1.5% uplift in sales and margin.
      Low price guarantee of a grocery retailer in Belgium, Their declaration to their 
        customer is - if their price is not the lowest, they will give the item for free.
        This is where we are helping them, to determine what the price strategy should be.
      A Supermarket in US, The retailer had 19 different banners, and all these banners were 
        run as independent companies. Opt-umera did a large pricing transformation for the 
        client, and brought all the banners under one platform and one pricing strategy, so 
        they could have a consistent pricing strategy across banners.
      A specialty retailer in US, who had 17 million items. Selling online, it is difficult 
        to manually price the items. Optumera’s AI-powered approach to pricing, considered 
        over 500 factors impacting sales, including page views of the item, popular search 
        terms, member or non-member purchase, conversion, and other online metrics.
      The bottom line is that Optumera has enabled retailers to achieve 3 to 5% increase 
        in sales and profitability, 30 to 50% reduction in time spent, execute 5 times more 
        strategies and 20 to 30% reduction in costs across customers.
