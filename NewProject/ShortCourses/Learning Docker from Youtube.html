        <pre>Learn Docker in 1 Hour | Full Docker Course for Beginners:

Introduction:
	Some applications works on windows, will not work on Linux, MAC due to OS. Some issue with version of libraries used.
	To standardized and make similar to run on all over the OS as well as version issues, docker was created.
	It resolves compatitability issues.
	In this course, we will learn:
		1) What Docker is?
		2) Why, When & How to use it?
		3) How to make life easier using docker?
		4) Master Docker Fundamentals
		5) Learn advanced concepts
		6) You'll learn to fully dockerize applications
		7) I'll teach you docker file syntax
		8) All the most important docker commands
		
What is Docker?
	Think about a lunch box, it contain rice, sambar, rasam, curd, poriyal etc... We can take the lunch box anywhere and eat food whenever. It will similar 
		like eating in kitchen.
	Same is what docker also, it also have code, dependencies, etc... We can run any applications anywhere(OS) with help of Docker.
	It is used for Development, Packaging and Execution.
	In this, we need to mention the necessary dependencies and package versions. It generates a self contained box which includes own operating system and
		all the components essential for running our application.
	The self contained box act as a separate computer which contain OS and all the necessary components to run our application smoothly.
	
Why should we use Docker?
	Big Application like Uber, Spotify, eBay etc... use docker which make easier for development and deployment with better and faster performance.
	1) Consistency across environments:
		It works in all the employee system, doesn't care about the OS, package versions, same commands for all the users. It reduces that in my system, 
			it is not working issue. It reduces confusion and better collaboration.
	2) Isolation:
		All the files, applications and dependencies are isolated to avoid clashes between them. It is like lunch box where we have isolated each items.
	3) Portability:
		Moving the container from stages development, testing, production is easy and faster. It shares the host system resources to make more efficient
			than other traditional methods.
	4) Version Control:
		It has version control like GIT where we can track the version of files and history. Similarly, we have in dockers. Here, we can track the application 
			by each version and if anything goes wrong with new version, we can easily switch to older version by one button click.
	5) Scalability:
		We can use multiple application and platform if more users needed. It is like restaurant menu, if more user comes, we provide more menus. But,
			content in menu is same for all.
	6) Devops Integration:
		It reduces the gap between development and deployment stages. Stream lining the flow from Dev to Ops.
		
How does Docker work?
	It works with 2 concepts: Images and Containers.
	Images:
		It is light weight, standalone, executable package that contains everything to run an application like code, runtime, libraries, system tools and OS.
		It is like a recipe instruction menu, it contains all the required details and steps to create the recipes. Using that we can create multiple 
			recipe with single instruction menu.
		Same as in Images also, we can create multiple containers with single image.
	Containers:
		It is an executable enviroment where images are executed. It follow instruction mentioned in images from install packages to run the application.
		It is the place where images are processed and preformed. It is like a kitchen, where the all the recipe are made.
	
	Terms used in Dockers:
		Volume: a persistant data storage mechanism that shares data between docker containers and host machine which is a computer or server or multiple 
			containers.
		Network: a connectivity between containers or between container and outside environment. It performs well even it is isolated from host machine.
			It works like a server in hotel who manges and gives orders to different chiefs in different envs and complete the work without collapse within
			them.
		
	Docker Workflow has 3 parts:
		Docker client
		Docker Host (Docker Daemon)
		Docker Registry (Docker Hub)
		
	Docker client is a User application where end user perform execution operation from development to deployment by giving commands.
	Docker Host is a backend process where instructions given clients will be executed here. It manages the containers and images.
	Docker Registry is like Github which contains both shared and private docker images. We can use it if we don't have it on local.
		
How to use Docker?
	First we neeed to install Docker Desktop from the official website. Accept all the recomendations.
	Open and just explore the main screen having Images, Containers, Volume, Builds, Dev Environments, Docker Scout.
	Explore the docker hub to see the public images in the portal.
	
	To create an Own docker image, we need to create a docker file. It has set of commands to run the application.
	Basic Commands to create docker file:
		FROM:  from where the base image to create the new image.
		WORKDIR: from which location to start the work.
		COPY: bring the required tools or files to location.
		RUN: execute the steps to create image.
		EXPOSE: where the created image going to execute.
		ENV: choose whether it is a production or build env.
		ARG: it defines build time variables which going to use.
		VOLUME: it is an extra space where some required files can you get from external storage.
		CMD: it starts the container to work as per the image.
		ENTRYPOINT: after container starts, it reach to entrypoint unless specific command provided.
		
		CMD vs ENTRYPOINT:
			CMD can be overriden, ENTRYPOINT can't be overriden.
			CMD is default execuable, ENTRYPOINT is fixed starting point.
			
	To run the docker image, let download from docker hub and run it from terminal.
