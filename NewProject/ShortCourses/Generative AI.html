        <pre>Gen AI:
	Chat GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)
	Open AI chat gpt 3.5, fine tuned for dialogue trained to produce text.
	1 million accounts created in 1 week, 100 million accounts created in 2 months.
	Fastest growing consumer application in history.
	Incredible product
	Learn and adapt chat gpt to leverage the work and increase productivity.
	
	There is no use even if we have world's super computer without know how to use it?
	Chat gpt is a most robust knowledge repository, so learn to use it. Otherwise it is a 
		simple chat bot.
	Chat gpt is a tool, if we learn how to use it, we can increase efficiency.
	Normal person can't become specialist using chat gpt, only specialist in specific fields
		can ask proper question to get more details.
	
	The simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems.

		Robotics (1960)
		Machine Learning (1990)
		NLP (1990)
		Computer Vision (2000)
		Deep Learning (2010)
		
	Other Gen AI:
		Dall E

	Prompt Engineering:
		Asking the right question for Gen AI.
		Details Matter, lot of right questions give the correct details 
			about the informations.
		Proper good question will give proper good answer. So, learn how to ask proper
			right questions.
	
	Question to be asked:
		What are you asking from the systems?
		What is your desired outputs?
		What do you want the results to be?
		Who? 
			Who you are? Who does Chat GPT simulate?
		Where should be used to get clear information regarding industry, sector, Geography.
		Why we asked the question?
		Why we need a response on a topic?
		Which aspects to focus on?
		Which elements should be included in the output?
		Which details need to be considered?
		How?
			Do we need an open ended question? Specific request? command?
			Do we need an answer in the shape of a bullet list in?
			How long should the answer be?
			How it should sound in terms of tone and languages etc.
			How creative it can be etc..
		The more effectively you guide the AI, the more valuable insights it will provide.
