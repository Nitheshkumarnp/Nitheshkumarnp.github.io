        <pre>Optumera Pricing:
  60% of the customers decide whether to buy a product or not, solely based on its price. 
    Fixing the price without understanding the landscape could lead retailers to losses 
    instead of increasing ROI
  Retail price considers the product costs as well as the supply and demand conditions; and 
    is the most effective way to manage margins
  Prices can drive a product’s brand image and position it to its target clientele. It drives 
    the market position and margin performance. It can signify who the target consumer is and 
	drive customer loyalty.
  Objective of Pricing:

	setting objectives, 
	to devising price strategy and executing the prices.
  Market Positioning:
	This helps to understand how a brand will resonate with the customer. 
	It could be positioned as a luxury brand.
	It is essential to determine what are we, as a retailer.
  Segmenting & targeting: 
	Target segment behavior is analyzed by targeting a specific type of clientele.
	Based on the previous analysis, retailers set the business objectives. It could 
	  be about maximizing revenue, optimizing costs, or increasing the product 
	  volume. Objectives can also be about targets such as achieving 6% reduction 
	  in costs, or achieving 5% uplift in top line. All of this is based on the 
	  analysis done earlier on the customer behavior, and the intended brand and 
	  marketing position of the brand towards target customer base.
  Determine Pricing Strategy:
	Set the price based on the customer behavior and earlier analysis.
  
  Once the prices are setup, they are sent for execution to the different channels.
	Today, retailers have multiple touch points for customers. Some retailers have 
	all the channels like store, e-commerce, social media, emails and mobile apps. 
	Some retailers only have stores and online.

  A 'markup' is 'a percentage added to the cost to get retail selling price.'
  One of the key means to address challenges in surviving the retail market 
    is the know-how involved in setting reasonable, competitive and attractive prices.
  
  How a pricing process takes place in retail and the different stakeholders that are 
    involved in it.
  The pricing process can be divided into functional blocks: 
    Planning stage, 
    Optimization, 
    Price management,
    Execution of price.
  
  The Pricing team looks closely at industry trends, collects the relevant data, and 
    monitors competitors' pricing strategies to validate the final recommendations. 
    Awareness of general economic trends, market developments, and consumer habits is 
    essential for the pricing team.
  
  Price segmentation is a pricing strategy where brands/retailers charge different 
    prices to different types of customers based on their ability and willingness to pay.
  
  Pricing strategies:
    Pricing strategies can be broadly divided into the categories: 
      Demand-oriented pricing strategy:
        Price skimming, 
        odd even pricing, 
        ***** pricing, 
        premium pricing,
        price bundling.
      Cost-oriented pricing strategy:
        cost plus pricing, 
        markup pricing, 
        breakeven pricing, 
        target return pricing,
        early cash recovery pricing
      Competition-oriented pricing strategy:
        competitors’ parity,
        discount pricing. 
      Differential pricing:
        customer segment pricing, 
        seasonal pricing,
        location pricing. 
      Last one is value-based pricing.
  
  Price Relationship:
    Retailers deal with more than 1 million items in their assortment every day. 
      Maintaining and tracking individual prices for all these items is very difficult.
    There are two major types of pricing relationships: 
      Item linking,
      Item grouping
    In Item linking:
      Individual items are linked with each other on a granular level, 
        and compared across geographies and brands.
      Compare and save method, is used by customer to compare the one product
        with other product and purchase the best one.
      Case to Piece method, is used by customer to analyse if we buy a bunch of product or 
        or individual piece based on price difference.
    In Item grouping:
      These linkages are maintained, and items are grouped in different groups together.
      Item grouping with an anchor item. In this case, it is not one item, but a whole 
        shampoo line with a retailer, where an item itself is a price family. An item 
        group is created based on the relationships between different items within the 
        same group. Here, an anchor item is identified, and the price of other items will 
        be derived from the anchor item of the group.
    Size parity:
      maintains a retail relationship between multiple sizes of the same item. 
        The price per unit of the larger item is lesser than the price per unit of the 
        smaller item.
        
  Retailers perform “Price Parity” when they sell products at same price in different 
    channels (online and offline) and countries. This helps them balance between business 
    models, fight predatory pricing and build loyal customer base.
  
  Pricing Concepts:
    Halo effects:
      Halo Effect can be defined as the bias shown by customers towards certain products, 
        because of a favorable experience they have had in the past. For example, iPhones 
        have a good brand image and customers are happy with it. When Apple launched 
        watches, they got favorable opinions from customers, who were willing to buy these 
        watches, because of the opinion they had on iPhones.
      So, when building a brand or pricing the items, retailers also need to consider the 
        halo effect that customers may have on these items.
    Cannibalization:
      Cannibalization, is an effect that is defined as the reduction in sales volume or 
        revenue of one product, because of introduction of another product.
      Whenever a retailer is introducing a new product, or is going to change the price 
        of one of the items, they need to consider its impact on the performance of 
        similar products. 
      The possibility for cannibalization should be considered by the retailer, before 
        introducing a new product, or before lowering the price of the product.
    Price Image and Price Blind:
      There are items where consumers are blind to the prices, and there are items where 
        the price of the item is registered in the customers’ mind. This is where an item 
        can be categorized into a medium sensitivity, low sensitivity, high sensitivity or 
        a KVI sensitivity. 
    Price points and Price ranges:
      A retailer in the US or the UK market may have different price zones, and each item 
        is priced differently in these different areas. That is, the price points will 
        differ from one area to another.
    Price zones and Price ranges:
      These are some of the factors taken into consideration while creating prices. 
        Loyalty of the customer, store location, competition, geography, ethnicity, 
        variety, products, and product and service availability.
    Price elasticity:
      Price elasticity is the change in demand, associated with a change in price.
      Determining price elasticity is an important calculation.
      So, the elasticity value can help retailers determine an item’s sensitivity to 
        price changes, and thereby arrive at the optimal price point. This leads retailers 
        to maximize their revenue and margin.
    Price optimization:
      This helps a retailer to experiment with and simulate different scenarios, giving 
        different weightages to business KPIs. In a scenario, the objective can be to 
        maximize revenue and arrive at the best price point. 
      Then the best price point can be arrived at, considering other factors like 
        competition, weather, demographics, store location, customer behavior, or 
        different segments that they are catering to. Considering all these factors, 
        one can answer questions such as - what is the best price point? and how can the 
        price points be changed dynamically? All of this, coupled with an understanding 
        of cross category and item effects, such as halo effect and cannibalization, 
        retailers can align their pricing strategy with their overall business strategy.

        of AI to make higher margins.
