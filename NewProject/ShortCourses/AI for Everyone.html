        <pre>Week 1 Introduction:
	AI is changing the way we work and live.If you want to understand how AI is affecting society, and how you can navigate that 
		you also learn that from this course.
	AI is estimated to create an additional 13 trillion US dollars of value annually by the year 2030.
	Even though AI is already creating tremendous amounts of value into software industry, a lot of the value to be created in 
		a future lies outside the software industry. In sectors such as retail, travel, transportation, automotive, materials, 
		manufacturing, and so on.
	There is a lot of excitement but also a lot of unnecessary hype about AI. 
	One of the reasons for this is because AI is actually two separate ideas. 
		Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI).
		Artificial General Intelligence(AGI). 
		ANIs that do one thing such as a smart speaker or a self-driving car or AI to do web search or AI applications in farming 
			or in a factory. These types of AI are one-trick ponies but when you find the appropriate trick, this can be 
			incredibly valuable.
		AGI is the goal to build AI. They can do anything a human can do or maybe even be superintelligence and do even more 
			things than any human can.
		Currently ANI is developing more than AGI. We will focus on ANIs which is focus on single task, that can help to solve 
			our problems and organisation.
		AGI will take more time or years to develop fully that will be helpful for reasearch analysis.
		In this course, we will focus on ANI, how to make effective of AI in our life. we will learn more ML, DL and how to 
			build an AI project and how to handle AI project which will help you overall understanding of AI.
			
Machine Learning:
	Most commonly used is Supervised Learning.
	Supervised learning to train a model with input and output data. Then used to predict the new input data.
	Simply, A -> B  or input -> output
	With Large amount of data (Big Data), the perfomance of model:
		Large NN > Medium NN > Low NN > Traditional AI

What is Data?
	Data is raw information. Dataset is a table of datas.
	Eg. Price prediction of house table, cat identification table.
	Acquiring data from many ways:
		Manual Entry(Labeling).
		Get from observing behaviour eg. Machine behaviour, usage of mobile application by user.
		Download from websites.
	Use and Misuse of Data:
		Collecting n years of data from IT team and give the data to AI team is not a proper way.
		After collecting some data, IT team should review to AI team. AI team will give feedback and tell the changes.
		Large amount of data will give more details, but the data should be relevant, useful and how data is stored.
		Dataset we received may have incorrect values, incorrect label columns, missing values.
		Efficiency of model will depends on quality of datas.If incorrect data are trained, then it will give incorrect results.
		Investing more on IT team to collect data without feedback from AI team is useless.
		
The Terminology of AI:
	We are not clear about what is Machine Learning, Data Science. So, we can't discuss with other clearly. Let's clarify it.
	Example used is home price prediction.
	Machine Learning:
		Definition: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
		Example content: Prediction of output using input data is ML, Model will be trained with input and output data.
		Input/Output: Inputs are independent features and Output is dependent feature.
	
	Data Science:
		Definition: Science of extracting knowledge and insights from data.
		Example content: Finding insights, ideas, solution from data and output is conclusion/summary of analysis.
		Input/Output: Input is dataset and Output is extraction of information, conclusion, summary in presentation way like power point or chart diagram.

	Deep Learning:
		Definition: It is designed and inspired by human brain. It is a big mathematical equation using ANN to map input to output data.
		Example content: Prediction of output using input data under Artificial Neural Network, Model will be trained with input, output data as well as
			tuning parameters and weights of neuron and features.
		Input/Output: Inputs are independent features and Output is dependent feature.

What makes an AI company?
	A rise of internet to navigate to rise of AI. Google and Baidu are good AI companies.
	Internet Era:
		Shopping Mall + Website != Internet Company
		Approaches:
			A/B Testing - 2 or 3 applications will be handled and performance will be tested parallelly.
			Short iteration time - changing things can be do in short time, if it is a shopping mall, then changes will take times.
			Decision Making and strategies should be from CEO to engineer, but it won't work in traditional companies other than internet company.
		
	AI Era:
		Any company + DeepLearning != AI Company
		Approaches:
			Strategic data acquisition
			Sell products for data acquisition, not for money.
			Unified Data warehouse - for easy data access.
			Prevasive automation of process.
			New roles like MLE etc..
		
	Making a company to AI company is a systematic process. It won't happen like magic.
	Five steps to approach for AI company:
		Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
		Build an in-house AI team
		Provide broad AI training
		Develop AI strategy
		Develop internal and External communications.
		
What ML can and can't do?
	Due to Over hype, anything can be done with ML. But it is not possible. Just by seeing input and output features, we can't preform ML.
	Most of the people are judging that AI can do anything with some stories, but more failure stories also there.
	ML can perform classification of card fraudulent, spam detection, translation etc, those can be automate soon.
	We cant' predict the stock price using the historical data.
	What makes the ML problems easier?
		Learning a simple concept, simple concept means as a human we can able to identify the cat or dog difference with in a second. Like that problems.
		Lot of datas available.
	
More Examples of what ML can and can't do:
	Self driving cars:
		It can able to detect the infront cars and able to behave as trained.
		But, if a person raise a hand infront of car, AI assistant don't know what is the intention of human whether to stop or help or pickup or 
			asking lift or take diversion. Each person activities will be unique and difficult to learn AI.
	X-Ray Scan to find pnuemonia:
		It can able to detect whether the pneumonia is present or not by seeing the x-ray.
		But, it can't detect the reason or severity of it. If we give set of image of x-ray and book to analyze and explain the issue, AI can't do. But
			an average medical student can do that.
	Advantages:
		Learning a simple concept.
		Lot of datas available.
	Disadvantages:
		Learning complex concept with limited datas.
		Predicting answer for the new data which it is not trained well.
		
Non-Technical Explanation of Deep Learning (Part 1 & 2):
	Single Feature:
		Input features: Price	Output feature: Demand 
		One neuron will work on it to find the demand.
	Multiple Feature:
		Input features: Price, Shipping Cost, Marketing, Material 	Output feature: Demand
		Three neuron will work on find Affordability, Awareness and preceived quality.
		One neuron will work on the output of above three neuron and give output as demand.
	In current scenarios, more than 1000 neurons are working in deep learning model to predict most complex problems.

	Face Recognition using Deep Learning will work with lot of neurons to identify the person.
	If an image is having 1000x1000 pixels, then 1 million of data is present in array form. If it is a colored image, then it have 3 million of data.
	Neuron inside the Neural network will try to split the parts of the face and train with different neurons. Final neuron will get details of each
		and predict the identification of person.

Week 2 Introduction:
	Till now, we learned about basic of AI like ML, DL and DS. Let we start how to use that.
	There are some sequence of steps need to follow to build AI project. Different projects having different steps. It is like organizing a birthday party.
	Starting an AI project:
		Workflow of projects
		Selecting AI projects
		Organizing data and team for a projects
		
Workflow of Machine Learning project:
	Example: Speech recognition
	Steps:
		Collection of data, when we speak Alexa or hello or any other things, device will collect our data.
		Train model, iterate many times for better results, device will get train on collected data.
		Deployment, once model is created, deployed in a machine. When device start to respond to a new data, if won't work effectively. Suppose, if we	
			train a model in British English, but tested with American English, it will fail. 
	Example: Self driving car
	Steps:
		Collection of data, collection of car images in road is collected to find the position of other cars.
		Train model, iterate many times for better results, device will get train on collected data.
		Deployment, once model is created, deployed in a car, The device start to respond to data, whenever it gets old data, it performs well, when it 
			go for new car model, it will fail. 
	In the workflow of machine learning project, we collect, train and deploy model and update and maintain to model to better with new datas.

Workflow of Data Science project:
	Example: Optimization of sale funnel
	Steps:
		Collection of data, collect user data which pages they visited, from where they checking, location and price of products.
		Analyze data, iterate many times to analyze better insights, check what is last page visited, location where they searched for shipping.
		Suggest Hypothesis/actions, deploy the changes, re-analyze the data and make decision/analyze better.
	Example: Manufacturing line of mug
	Steps:
		Collection of data, collect the mug details where made, who, temperature, time to make, etc..
		Analyze data, iterate many times to analyze better insights, check who make this, what brand of sand, manufacturer.
		Suggest Hypothesis/actions, deploy the changes, re-analyze the data and make decision/analyze better.
		
Every job function need to learn how to use data:
	Due to data digitalization in all over the world, Every job is using data to optimize their work. ML and DS helping for bigger changes.
	Few examples:
		Sales:
			DS: Sales Optimization funnel, analyzing the reason for checkout and discard.
			ML: Automated Lead Sorting using tags of priority.
		Manufacturing line:
			DS: Optimizing and analyzing the mug manufacturing and finds the reason for defects.
			ML: Automate the inspection of finding the defected mugs.
		Recruitment:
			DS: Optimize by analysing the user response for email, phone screen, onsite opportunity, offer etc...
			ML: Screening resume by searching contents.
		Marketing:
			DS: A/B Testing, understanding the user's click on button of different color to promote marketing.
			ML: Customized product recommendation.
		Agriculture:
			DS: Crop analytics, analyzing the weather, land, crop condition and other various factors to optimize production.
			ML: Automate the weed removal by taking picture on land used weed spray on specific place instead of all over the land.

How to choose an AI project (Part 1):
	For choosing an AI project, we need domain knowledge as well as AI knowledge.
	AI knowledge knows what can we do with AI and can'ts with AI.
	Domain knowledge knows what can add value for the business.
	We need to combine both AI and domain knowledge to choose a right AI project.
	
	BrainStorming Framework:
		Think about automating task rather than automating job.
		What are the main drivers of business value?
		What are the main pain points in your business?	

	We can make progress even without big data:
		Having more data almost never hurts.
		Data makes some business defensible.
		But with small data, we can progress.
		Eg. we don't need millions of defective mugs to detect a defective mugs. Few 100's is enough for good model.

How to choose an AI project (Part 2):
	There are different projects and some project we can do in few days, some project in months, and others in years.
	Before going to start the project, analyze few conditions.
	Technical deligence:
		Can AI meet the desired performance.
		How much data is required.
		Engineering Timeline.
	Business deligence:
		Lower cost.
		Higher revenue.
		Launch new product or business.
	Ethical deligence:
		Whether it will help society or not.
		Will it create any useful surround us and not harm others.
		Check this one before creating an AI project.
	Build Vs Buy:
		In all the products, we have one question, whether we can build or buy to get efficiency.
		In DS and ML also have same question, whether we need to build  or buy a DS or ML models.
		Many ML projects are already developed and standardized, so some companies will buy that projects and some others may build.
		Most DS projects are in-house only, analyze will take day-day efforts or even more. So, build a projects is advantage.
		Some thing with industry standard, avoid building those.
		
Working with AI team:
	Specify the acceptance creteria like Goal of % accuracy.
	Expecting 100% accuracy is impossible with:
		Limitation of ML model,
		Insufficient data,
		Mislabled data,
		Ambigious label
		
Technical tool for AI team:
	AI teams uses various tools to make their work efficiently. Some tools are mentioned below under open-source framework.
	Machine Learning Framework:
		PyTorch,
		TensorFlow,
		Hugging Face,
		Scikit-Learn,
		PaddlePaddle,
		R
	
	Research publication:
		Arxiv
	
	Open source repository:
		GitHub
		
	CPU vs GPU:
		CPU - Central Processing Unit used in computer for lot of computational process.
		GPU - Graphic Processing Unit used in computer for processing images which highly used in high end video games. Currently used in LLM and DL models.
		
	Cloud vs On-Premises vs Edge (deployment):
		Cloud - server is rented from others and deploy our model there.
		On-Premises - server is created on own and run on local host computer.
		Edge - server and model are deployed in place where the data is generated. Eg. In self driving car, we can't send data to internet and wait for 
			response to react. Like that smart speakers also.
	
Week 3 Introduction:
	Building AI to a company will add value to the company.
	Points to build AI in your company:
		Case studies of complex AI products,
		Roles in an AI team,
		AI Transformation Playbook(Road Map),
		Taking your first step
		
Case Study Smart Speaker:
	Let's see what are the steps we have to follow to build a smart speaker.
	When we say "Hi Device, can you tell a joke?"
	Steps:
		Trigger work/ Wakeupword detection		- Hi Device
		Speech recognition						- can you tell a joke?
		Intent recognition						- intent of asking the question
		Execute joke							- telling the joke

	Smart speaker works based on the instructions and training data and conditions to access based on commands.
	AI Pipeline is used to automate the steps.
	Eg. "Hi Device, can you set timer for 10 minutes".
	
Case Study Self Driving Car:
	Let's see what are the steps we have to follow to build a Self Driving Car.
	Steps for deciding how to drive:
		Image/Radar/Ridar sensor to capture car or person or obstacles infront of car.
		Using GPS and Map also for more accuracy and find best route.
		Detection of car, person, obstacles which are trained via supervised learning.
		Prediction of next trajectory for car, person.
		Motion Planning will decide the what to do for car ? Steer/Accelerate/Brake.
	Images/Radar -> Detection of car, person, traffic signal, Lane, Obstacles -> Trajectory prediction -> Motion Planner

Example roles of an AI team:
	Still AI is emerging, so 100 % roles are not defined. Roles differs from once company to another company.
	Some Roles in AI team:
		Software Engineer,
		Machine Learning Engineer,
		Machine Learning Researcher,
		Applied Data Scientist,
		Data Scientist,
		Data Engineer,
		AI Product Manager

AI Transformation Playbook (Part 1):
	Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
	Build an in-house AI team
	Provide broad AI training
	Develop AI strategy
	Develop internal and External communications.
	
	Execute pilot projects to gain momentum:
		Always try to get success at first instead of good experience.
		Don't go for big projects at first to gain knowledge. Go for success even at small rate.
		Success helps to make more things.
		
	Build an in-house AI team:
		To teach and learn AI to all the level of employees, we need to build an in-house AI team.
		Team should in invest money to learn AI to all the employees for efficient performance.
		
	Provide broad AI training:
		Based on different roles, different level of AI training need to give.
		AI topics for CEO, MD and CO will differ from software developer and team leaders.
		Duration to learn also differ between each and every one.

AI Transformation Playbook (Part 2):
	Develop AI strategy:
		Consider creating data strategy:
			Strategic data acquisition.
			Unified data warehouse.
		Create network effect and platform advantages in industry with "winner takes all" dynamics
		
	Develop internal and external communications:
		Investor relations,
		Government relations,
		Customer/User educations,
		Talent/Recruitment,
		Internal Communication
		
	Strategy is the most important thing in creating AI company, then only excuting pilot projects, inhouse AI team and AI training.
	Start creating AI with smaller data and make some success and promote the product and get more data from real time and improve the model, each time
		to get more stablize. Eg. Helping farmer using AI to remove weed from crops.
		
AI pitfalls to avoid:
	Do's and Don'ts in AI:
		we should clear about what AI can and can't do
		Hiring 2-3 ML engineer and start working is not a proper way. Business knowledge person also required.
		Both Technical and business deligence is required.
		Don't try to start project with big team, even small team is there, go for that. They will groom and make projects better and better.
		First project will be good, Second project will be better and Third project will be best. Improvement will be there.
		Expecting project to be complete in first attempt is a wrong one. it is an iterative process will go for improvement and success.
		
Taking your first step in AI:
	Get friends who are interested in AI,
	Start brainstorming project even it is simple,
	Hire/ Appoint a ML/DS engineer to get help,
	Approach higher level person to get more information about project.
	Start with what we can, then AI efforts will grow.
	
Survey of Major AI application areas(Optional):
	One of the biggest achievement in Deep learning is Computer Vision.
	
	Using Computer Vision, There are many applications used:
		Image Classification / Object Recognition,
		Object Detection,
		Image Segmentation,
		Tracking

	Image classification help in identifying the images of cat or not. Object Detection detects the cars and pedestrains the road by rectangle box. Image 
		Segmentation segments the exact boundaries of the object which detected in object detection. Tracking helps to track the moving objects or person
		during self driving car.
	
	Next is Natural Language Procession(NLP):
		Text classification,
		Information Retrieval,
		Name-entity recognition,
		Machine translator
		
	Text classification helps in classifying the text whether email is spam or not. Review given are good or not and predicting rating for the review.
		Information Retrieval means web search the details and extract the relevant information. Name-entity recognition means identifying the name or place
		from the given paragraph. Machine translator translate one language to another language.
		
	Next is Speech:
		Speech Recognition,
		Trigger word/ Wakeup direction,
		Speaker Identification,
		Speech Synthesis

	Speech recognition converts the speech to text and go for NLP process. Trigger word used in smart speaker to start the speaker to listen. Speaker 
		identification is used to identify the speaker whether who is speaking, is it our owner or other person. Speech Synthesis converts the text to 
		speech to give response to user.
		
	Next is Gen AI:
		AI systems that can produce high quality content, specifically text, images, and audio.
		
		Text generation: It generates contents and answer to the question asked by user.
		Image generation: Based on the user commands, images can be generated by AI.
		Audio generation: Based on the user commands, audio can be generated by AI.
		
	Next is Robotics:
		AI used in Robotics for better performance of it. Eg. Self driving car.
		Perception: figuring out what's in the world around you.
		Motion planner: finding a path for the robot to follow.
		Control: Sending commands to the motors to follow a path.
		
	Last is General machine learning:
		Currently, AI is more focusing on unstructured data over structured data.
		Most common unstructured data are image, audio and texts. (easy for human to understand)
		Structured data are table format datas. (Easy for machine to understand)

Survey of Major AI Techniques(Optional):
	Unsupervised Learning:
		Unsupervised Learning is most using one after Supervised Learning.
		Clustering is the most useful techniques in unsupervised learning.
		Eg. Potato chips packet analysis based on size of packets.
		In Unsupervised  learning, given data without any specific output labels, find something interesting about the data.
		We don't need 1000 images of coffee mug to tell our children or animal, but supervised learning needs more than human needs to learn. In future, 
			more changes will happen in unsupervised learning and expect to learn like human.
	
	Transfer Learning:
		Using knowledge which already learned from one supervised learning to learn new similar thing is called transfer learning.
		Eg. Self driving car model is trained to detect normal cars which trained with 10,000 images. When it tried to detect the golf car which is not
			seen during training. Now, Training to learn new golf won't need 10,000 images. It can be trained with 100 images. Because it already
			know to detect car and parts of car. It just need some new parts of golf car to detect.
			
	Reinforcement Learning:
		Learning by its own by giving feedbacks. It try to get more positive feedbacks.
		Whenever the model works good, user give positive feedback. If model works bad, then user give negative feedback.
		Model will be trained to get more positive feedbacks.
		Eg. Autonomous helicopter to try fly individual with reinforcement learning. Positive and negative feedbacks will be provided based on activity.
			It is like training a dog and giving appreciate and bitting for good and bad activity. Dog will learn to do more good things.
		Reinforcement learning is still in development stage, more and quick advancement will come in future.
		
	Generative Adversarial Network(GANs):
		Synthesis new images from scratch.
		Eg. Changing face of celebraties and friends recently are the GANs actitivies.
		It is used in media, games, graphics and entertainments etc...
		
	Knowledge Graph:
		Have information about a person, thing, movie, event, etc...
		It is like wikipedia which show the details of person with main information like name, dob, role, father, mother, etc...
		It is introducted by Google, currently it is used in large giant companies to save the data or information about the organization.
		The activity on KG is low compared to other AI techniques.
		
Week 4 Introduction:
	AI and Society:
		AI is growing faster and making the society more reliable.
		AI and hype: unnecessary hype are there for AI can do.
		Limitations of AI: Not all the things can be do by AI, there are few limitations we have to know. New technologies are growing and can make the AI
			Fool, AI should be learn accordingly.
		AI developing economies and jobs: Economy of Big countries are increased by AI and new jobs are coming for AI and lot of jobs are lost by AI.
		Both advantage and disadvantage are there in AI.
		AI that we are covering should be ethical and not harm others.
	
A realistic view of AI:
	Goldilock's rule for AI:
		Too Optimistic: AI will solve all the human problems is impossible.
		Too Pessimistics: AI can lead the Human and cause harmful to our existence.
		Just right: AI is a powerful tools but has limitations.
		
	Limitations of AI:
		Performance's limitations.
		Explainability is hard.
		Biased AI through biased data.
		Adversarial attacks on AI.
		
	Optimistic means confident on AI that it can solve all the problems and make the human free and can do anything whatever we want. It can make us to 
		live longer and cure all the diseases.
	Pessimistic means wrong belief that AI can over rule the human and create harm to human in future.
	AI is hard to explain why the decision is taken, on what basis decision are made. Sometimes human also faces issue to explain the concept or issues.
		Still, AI is evolving, it will be solved in future.
	We want to treat each and every human as equal. but when we trained with biased data of gender, partiality based data, it leads to biased result.
	Adversarial attack means some unwanted person will try to make the AI fool and want to make profit or personal advantage of it.

Discrimination/Bias:
	AI learning unhealthy stereotypes means similar answer.
		Eg. Man: Woman 		King: Queen
			Man: Woman 		Father: Mother
			Man: Computer programmer 	Woman: Homemaker
	
	Why bias matters:
		Hiring tools that discriminated against woman.
		Facial recognition working well for light skinned person than dar skinned person.
		Bank loan approvals.
		
	Combating Bias:
		Technical solutions are use the less biased or more inclusive data.
		Transparency and diverse workforce.
		
Adversarial attack on AI:
	It is like making the AI fool. In some scenarios, AI will fail to identify the correct thing.
	Examples:
		Hamming bird  when resized and detect as Hammer.
		Hare when resized and detect as Desk.
		Normal human after wearing specs detect as celebrity.
		Stop board with some painting in top and bottom don't detect the stop board in self driving car.
		Banana can be misclassified as toaster when we add some sticker near banana.
	These adversarial attack can be defended, but it will take most cost and time to train.

Adverse use of AI:
	DeepFakes:
		Fake videos are created using images and synchronized and make it as real which the person has never done. It is used in social media recently,
			but It will harm and cause various issues if these technology used wrongly.
	Undermining of Democrazy and Privacy:
		These fakes and fraud activities can be identified by another set of AI which can easily detect those changes in video. But, the videos spread on
			the internet or social media don't know till the confirmation by the AI technology. This will create a privacy issue.
	Generating Fake Comments:
		Fake comments on various website have been made by AI to attract more number of users.
	
AI and Developing Economy:
	Most of the low rated jobs like agriculture farming, industrial work and cottage industries works are automated using AI which reduces the work of
		person and jumps to some other jobs. The approach of automating everything from lower to higher end jobs are increasing rapidly in current society.
	Currently, when we want to go for any product, we looks for latest one. Like that when someone want to start a business, they will go for AI technology,
		to increase efficiency and revenue without hard work.
	Eg. US and China were used landlines in 1990's more. So, they find difficult to make transition to mobile phones. When India started to develop on mobiles,
		It directly went for mobile phones instead of landlines.
	AI competition around the world is started and everyone is trying to give the best for their country and the world. Instead of doing best AI against other
		countries, try to do best AI technologies where you already good at.
	Teach and train the AI to all over the countries. So, that they can also develop and use it.
	Lot of countries who don't have proper education facilities are moving to online education which is a latest technology for advancement of lifes.

AI and Jobs:
	Lot of jobs are already automated by AI. By 2030, more number of jobs going to be displaced by AI. But analytics shows that more number of jobs are 
		going to create than displaced by AI. But the roles are different than now. All those jobs will be related to AI and specialization of fields.
	Top jobs going to replaced by AI are office support, production work, agriculture, food service, community service, customer service and sales etc...
	After AI entry:
		Our life will be continuous learner(life long learner).
		New technology will come and we have to learn and adapt to that technology to survive.
		If someone is specialized in one field and want to learn AI and transform to AI jobs, then it is not a correct one. They can learn the AI and use
			it in the field where they specialized at. That is the good approach to growth and AI and lifes.
