        <pre>Azure Course: AI-050 Develop Generative AI Solutions with Azure OpenAI services.
 
AI - Intelligent Machine
 
History:
	AI in 1950
	ML in 1990
	DL in 2010
	Gen AI in 2021
	Gen AI can create new content and it is a pretrained model. It works on prompt which can be splitted into tokens and input and output will come as 
		token format.
	Others can give result based on trained data.
	3 models with same algorithm but having 3 months, 6 months and 12 months of data. The performance of model will higher with more number of data.
	Like that, ChatGPT 4 has pretrained with data till 2023, ChatGPT 3.5 has pretrained with data till 2021. Performance and knowledge of ChatGPT 4 is higher
		compared to ChatGPT 3.5.
		
Create an Azure OpenAI service:
	Subscribe azure first, then click on Azure OpenAI.
	Select subscription, Resource Group is the most important one, which store all the details of configuration.
	Region selection is next important one, it is due to model availability, cost, latency, network efficiency and performance.
	Name giving to the instance should be unique within Resource group, not required to unique within subscription.
	After giving basic details, go for network tab, we have to give permission through network. From which network can access it. The option are all access, 
		strict to separate internet, and private internet only.
	Final step to review and confirm, in this it will validate the access of you and policy you have to create it. If it is okay, it will create.
