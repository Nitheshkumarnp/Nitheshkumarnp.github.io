        <pre>Course From DeepLearning.ai : Building Generative AI Applications with Gradio
Introduction:
	Gradio is a simple web interface which used to show a quick demo of Machine Learning or Generative AI applications.
	It is a python interface, we don't need a JavaScript or other front end work to show quick demo or display of results.
	In this, we are going to use HuggingFace along with Gradio and applications like text summarization, name entity recognition, image captioning, image 
		generation using diffusion model and LLM based Chatbot.

NLP Task Interface:
	In this, we will look 2 NLP task, text summarization and name entity recognition.
	Gradio is used to give quick demo to others for any application or result with quickly ready interface.
	Suppose if we are creating a small specialist model designed for a specific task. Eg. copilot of POS or other applications. We don't need to implement
		it in the specific application. Instead of that, we can create a simple web interface and check the response directly in Gradio.
	Small Specific Model created for copilot from the LLM model have same performance as general purpose LLM. But it is cheaper and faster than general
		purpose LLM model.
	BART Large CNN Model:
		This model uses a process called distillation.
		Distillation uses a prediction of large model to train a smaller model.
		We are using a shleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 model, a 306M parameter trained by Facebook.
	BERT Model:
		This is a Machine Learning model for Natural Language Processing.
		When parsing a text, it is useful to identify specific entity such as person, places, companies etc..
		bert-base-NER, a 108M parameter fine tuned BERT model ready to use for Name Entity Recognition(NER).
	Let's see the steps how it done in this tutorial:
		Importing the packages.
		Creating a helper function for api request of user query to get summary of query as response. Model is running behind the api and summarized result
			will after model performance is done.
		
		import gradio as gr
		def summarize(input):
			output = get_completion(input)
			return output[0]['summary_text']
		gr.close_all()
		demo = gr.Interface(fn=summarize, inputs="text", outputs="text")
		demo.launch(share=True, server_port=int(os.environ['PORT1']))
		
		This is the sample code snippet for gradio application to launch with simple input and output fields.
		
		After that, customizing the input and output label and height of input text box, title and description.
		Customizing the output field by providing hightlighted text. It display the response along with entity hightlighted. But it will have entity 
			separated with token. Some words are splitted by 2 or more tokens with B-Beginning and I-Intermediate tokens. To avoid that, merge the 
			tokens to get single words as entity for clear understanding.
		Added examples for quicker usage of filling input field for testing results.
		
		For summarization, model="shleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6" is used.
		For Name Entity Recognition(NER), model="dslim/bert-base-NER" is used.
		
Image Captioning App:
	Creating an application to give caption based on image given by user.
	In this, we are using open source image to text converter model - Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base a 14M parameter captioning model.
	The model trained on supervised learning by lot of images and captions.
	This model will run in end point url and get back the response of caption to display for user.
	Let's see the steps how it done in this tutorial:
		Importing the packages.
		Creating a helper function for api request of user query to get caption for image.
		Customizing the input field to images and type as PIL and creating functions to convert the image to base64 and BytesIO to send image in bytes.
		Other fields are same as previous one, like output text field, examples images, title, description and etc...

Image Generation App:
	Creating an application to generate image based on user caption. It is opposite to Image Captioning App.
	Both model are trained on supervised learning by lot of images and captions.
	In this, text-to-image model generates images from input text. The model used is open source runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 using the diffusers library.
	Let's see the steps how it done in this tutorial:
		Importing the packages.
		Creating a helper function for api request of user query to get image for caption.
		testing with sample prompt to check image result.
		Generating with Gradio Interface, helper function will get caption from user and generate base64 encoded response. We use another function to 
			convert base64 to PIL type and getting result to output field.
		Then, building some advanced option interface like slider to control values from min to max ranges.
		Later, customizing the application using Blocks. In Blocks, we have rows and columns. using that we can create different pattern or style of UI.
		Finally, Scale is used to set column width 4:1 or other values and Accordion to show and hide some contents. 
	From this section, we learned to customize the Gradio Application according to our needs.

Describe and Generate App:
	In this, we are going to combine the previous apps, image captioning and image generation.
	First we will upload an image and get caption as result and using the result, generating a new image.
	Let's see the steps how it done in this tutorial:
		Importing the packages.
		Creating a helper function for api request of user query to get image for caption as well as get caption for image upload.
		Create other function to convert image to base64, convert base64 to image, function to pass value to request and display results.
		First, checking whether it gives caption for image upload and working as expected or not.
		Then, creating app with one input field to image upload and 2 button to generate caption and image.
		Finally, creating app with one input field to image upload and one button to generate both caption and image.
		
Chat with LLM model:
	In this, we are going to building a chat bot using open source LLM model - falcon-40b-instruct model.
	Let's see the steps how it done in this tutorial:
		Importing the packages.
		Create a helper function to communicate with LLM model give and get response.
		Check the functionality with random prompt.
		Creating a gradio app to check a simple functionality of prompt and answer in input and output values.
		Then, creating a gradio app with random response to check functional flow gradio.Chatbot object for chat history.
		Later, integrating the llm model response with chat history and checking functionality.
		Finally, creating a gradio app with advanced functionality like system prompt and temperature inside accordion and user prompt in open and chat 
			conversation will display, and it show response like typing the result instead of waiting for longer time to get full response. Usually
			we can see in ChatGPT, the result comes like typing.
