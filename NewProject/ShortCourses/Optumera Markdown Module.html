        <pre>Optumera Markdown:
  Markdown is a permanent reduction in the product selling price.
  Basically, a retailer may offer a markdown, due to difficulty in selling an item at its 
    regular price.
  There are various reasons like:
    The product life is ending,
    The season is ending,
    Due to planogram changes,
    Due to overstocking of items or poor performance of items. So the potential reasons for 
      markdown could be due to poor promotional event and, poor performance of an item or 
      the initial base price setting of an item is too high, which leads to markdowns or 
      having an uncompetitive price proportional that could also lead to markdowns.
  Markdown vs Promotion:
    The markdownâ€™s single goal is, to get rid of end of life inventory, by the end of season, 
      by reducing the permanent price.
    Promotions are a temporary price reductions of items to uplift the sales, or to increase 
      the in store traffic, or to bring the familiarity of the products, which are newly 
      launched.
    The other underlying Aspects of a markdown could be, Aggressively drive out the low slow 
      movers, or to clear fragmented stocks, or to offload aged stocks, or to make room for 
      newly launching products.
    Other underlying concepts for markdown promotion could be, to attract the customers, or 
      to create a hype or excitement for the newly launched products, or to help sell slow 
      movers to drive out volume units or to protect margins, but discounting at less 
      percentages.
  So, the main objective of markdowns are:
    clear stocks, while maximising the revenue,
    sell the seasonal items, before the season ends,
    Clear stocks to make room for the new assortment plan,
    boost sales for underperforming items,
    move products before their expiration dates
  
  The red and white clearance label help customers to know about discounts.
  Top right corner contains the percentage of the discount and bottom left corner contains 
    the original price of the item.
  
  Markdown Management:
    It is a strategic way to create markdown planning and execute it to drive the customers
      to retail stores and online. 
      The main functions of markdown management:
      identifying the scope and defining the objective of the markdown,
      create markdown strategies considering the seasonality in demographics, 
      define the markdown types and cadence to be executed, focus the markdown benefits and 
      optimise the markdown and makes customer aware, and make them understand the process
      of the model, 
      Basically, being transparent to the customer on the marked out and help 
      the organisation achieve the goals and improve its finances.
  
  Factors that are considered mainly for markdown optimization:
    changing customer needs,
    competitive landscape,
    product risks,
    macroeconomic factors
  
  Category Reset:
    Category reset is something known as merchandise reset as well. This is a process of 
      rearranging the products, in a given category to optimize product replacement on 
      shelves
    The purpose of category reset is to remove any item that are not selling well in order 
      to make room for a new product, or facings of the product.
  
  Sell By Date:
    In grocery mainly, There are many fresh or prepared foods that are labelled with sell 
      by date as guided and how long the item should be displayed for sale before quality 
      deteriorates.
  
  Use By Date:
    Use by date states the time, up to which the food is safe to eat. This is majorly for 
      the perishable items. They're generally imposed on high risk foods which require 
      refrigeration, such as fish, meat products, pre-prepared foods and dairy products.
  
  Yellow Sticker Shopping:
    As we discussed in the process flow, foods, which are nearing to the sell by date or a 
      use by date, will be monitored by the retailer, and optimized price is decided. Once 
      the optimized price is decided, the store operator will print the labels with an 
      updated price, and will be sticked on an item.
  
  Markdown Policies:
    markdown as you go or early markdown,
    event base markdown or late markdown.
  
  Three types of markdowns:
    Clearance markdown,
    Damaged goods markdown,
    Competitive markdown or price matching markdown.
  
  Markdown Strategies:
    Proactive,
    historical data,
    evaluate the strategies for the prior season,
    understand the trends in data,
    real time course corrections,
    explain your markdown to your customers,
    designate a clearance area,
    use marketing budget to tell you customers about markdowns,
    Align your strategy with industry standards
  
  Markdown cadence pattern:
    Normally, an apparel industry has 12 weeks of a sales period for a season.
    First 4 weeks may be promotion sale,
    If the product is not going well, markdown 1 will launched with 25% or less.
    After 8 weeks, markdown 2 will be launched with 50%.
    Finally, it will go with 90% or lowest possible price.
  
  For intelligent markdown,  the granularity of the data plays an important role, 
    in optimization of the markdown. markdown calculation process is required to find the 
    optimized markdown.
  When there is unnecessary markdowns contributing to the Net margin, or a poor pricing 
    decision increasing the liquidity in the inventory, it leads to thin margins and 
    unsold inventory, which impacts the profit : how do we better get the profits, is 
    through markdown optimization.
