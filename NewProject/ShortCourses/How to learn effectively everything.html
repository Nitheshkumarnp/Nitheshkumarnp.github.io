        <pre>Strategy to Learn:
  7 steps to learn anything effectively.
  To learn, first you need right technique, plan and mindset.

Steps:
  1) Time Management
  2) Focus
  3) Comprehension
  4) Note-taking
  5) Memory
  6) Output
  7) Accountability Partner

Time Management:
  Time is limited.
  Daily or Weekly time limit need to set.
  Based on behaviour, Daily or weekly limit is required.
  Fix a proper time to learn.
  Better plan gives better results.
  Block the calender and other plans on that time.
  Note the topic, not the subject in calender or some where in notes, 
    what are you going.
  
Focus:
  Time: is important, find the proper and right time to learn.
  Place: should be good and don't have any distractions. 
  Duration: should not be too long to stretch. It should be max of 15 minutes.
    Then little break.
  Devices: should be in silent mode and should not disturb you.
  Proper Focus will gain more details about the subject.
  
Comprehension:
  Comprehend improves long term memory.
  First understand, then memorize.
  Without understanding, whatever learning will go as short term memory and 
    waste our time on spending.
  Discuss with relevant person or search on online to understand more about
    that topic.
  Sharing details with other will improve Comprehend and long term memory.
  
Note-taking:
  Note taking helps to understand the memory of concept that we learned.
  Points need to take notes:
    Main concepts: of the topic
    Summary: of the topic
    Action Steps: need to implement what we learned from that if possible.
      not all topic we can implement it.
  Helpful when we learn new things.
  If not able to remember properly, then go back and learn that again properly.
  Main concept helps to understand the concept for long term memory.
  Action steps helps to get the results.
  Both are required to get memory for long term.
  
Memory:
  Memorize the concept using simple and advanced techniques.
  Simple means chunk the details what we learned and try to remember the informations.
  Advanced means Visualization and Association.
  Visualization means visualize the concept how it will happen in real time.
    Memory power will be high when we visualize the things than simply understand
    understand the concept.
  Brain usually remember the pictures better than anything else.
  Association means link the new concept that you are learned with the already
    familiar one, that will create a strong bond and help to remember more.
    
Output:
  Output is some what we are getting details from our memory.
  Whatever steps we followed like focus, Comprehend and memory are inputs. 
    Note-taking and Action steps are the output which we write from our understanding.
  HILO and LIHO are the two concepts.
  High Input and Low Output (HILO) usually people do to learn more things but not able to
    implement or use in real time. They waste time in learning only Without implementing.
  Low Input and High Output (LIHO) only few people do to get better results. Learn few things
    and implement in multiple various places.
  Various ways to get better Output:
    Implement - try to implement whatever learned in available resources.
    Share - try to share details or discuss with other to get more clarity.
    Test - try to check whatever learn from that topic in available time.
    Revise - try to revise the topic in frequent time for better long term memory and no
      need to learn the same topic again from scratch.
  
Accountability Partner:
  Try to report to someone who cares and trust about our progress.
  Report in regular basis, discuss the topics, doubts and new ideas.
  Regular basis is helpful if we forget to report, they will ask about it. That will
    motivate us to learn more.
