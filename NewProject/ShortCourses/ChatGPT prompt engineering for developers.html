        <pre>Course From DeepLearning.ai : Chat GPT Prompt Engineering for Developers:
Introduction:
	Two types of Large Language Models (LLM):
		Base LLM
		Instruction Tuned LLM
	 
		Base LLM:
			Predicts next word, based on text training data.
			Eg. what is the capital of France? instead of answering the question, it predicts the next word what is the france's populations?
		Instruction Tuned LLM:
			Tries to follow instructions.
			Fine-tune on instructions and good attempts at following those instructions.
			RLHF: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback.
			Helpful, Honest, Harmless
			Eg. what is the capital of France? It will give the answer as the capital of France is Paris.
			This Instruction Tuned LLM are used mostly which will follow instructions according to our usecase. In this course, we will learn more about it.
			
Guidelines:
	pip install openai to install openai package
	Prompting Principles:
		Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
		Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
		Tactics (Principle 1):
			Use Delimiter to ask questions. Eg. asking to summarize the text inside ```{text}```.
			Ask for structured outputs. Eg. asking to give output in JSON format.
			Check whether condition is satisfied or not. Eg. asking to send output in step by step if satisfy or else no steps provided.
			Few shot prompting (asking chat gpt to continue conversations) Eg. conversation btw child and grandmother about asking stories.
		Tactics (Principle 2):	
			Specify the instructions in steps required to complete a task. Eg. ask for summary, then translate, name of the content and output in JSON object.
			Ask for output in specific format. Eg. the above response will confuse the user, so asking for specific format in JSON.
			Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion. Eg. If we give a student's solution to check whether it is 
				correct or not, it will say correct only. To fix the issue, we have to ask the model to solve the problem first, then compare the result.
	Model Limitations:
		Hallucinations:
			Sometimes answering the question which is not correct. If we ask about a company and their non-product, it will explain that product. To avoid it,
				we have give relevant document to read first and ask to answer that document itself.
			
Iterative Prompt Development:
	It means prompt will be in lifecycle like idea, prompt, response.
	Prompt Guidelines:
		Be clear and specific,
		Analyze why result does not give desired output.
		Refine the idea and prompt.
		Repeat.
	Eg. Asking to write description to the product.
		The text is too long. Eg. asking to give results in 50 or 100 words.
		Text focuses on the wrong details. Eg. asking to give results on specification of product.
		Description needs a table of dimensions. Eg. asking to give result in html format of table dimensions.	
	Load Python libraries to view HTML:
		# python code to display the HTML text in screen.
		from IPython.display import display, HTML
		display(HTML(response))
 
Summarizing:
	Text to summarize.
	Summarize with a word/sentence/character limit.
	Summarize with a focus on shipping and delivery.
	Summarize with a focus on price and value.
	Try "extract" instead of "summarize".
	Summarize multiple product reviews (each reviews stored in list and used for loop).
	
Inferring:
	Whatever activities are we doing from LLM models can be done by manually creating model and deploying it. But, the process of collecting data, training
		model and checking the performance will take more time for the application development process. And doing multiple conditions for different performance
		activities like summary, sentiment, transforming, identifying, chating will be more complex. But using the well trained LLM will easy solve it.
	Sentiment (positive/negative). Eg. lamp review as positive.
	Identify types of emotions. Eg. happy, satisfied, grateful, impressed, content.
	Identify anger. Eg. whether the review having anger or not.
	Extract product and company name from customer reviews. Eg. extracting item and brand name from review.
	Doing multiple tasks at once. Eg. Doing all the above the activies in single prompt by giving all the conditions.
	Inferring topics. Eg. getting the topic of the content, NASA.
	Infer 5 topics. Eg. getting the topic of the 5 contents in using list.
	Make a news alert for certain topics. Eg. In the list, if we have NASA, then make an alert message like conditions.
 
Transforming:
	Translation. Eg. translating to french and spanish.
	Formal and Informal translation. Eg. we can translate to formal and informal english or other languages.
	Universal Translator. Eg. it can translate to english, french and french in english words.
	Tone Transformation. Eg. asking to write the mail in formal or polite way to reply.
	Format Conversion. Eg. converting from JSON to HTML format.
	Spellcheck/Grammar check. Eg. proofread is the word mentioned in instruction to correct the grammatical mistakes and redlines are used to see the correction. 

Expanding:
	Asking the model to write briefly about the topic or context. Eg. asking to automate a reply mail based on customer reviews.
	Temperature will be used for 2 purposes:
		Temperature = 0 task which require reliability, predictability
		Temperature => 0.5 task which require wider variety
	Customize the automated reply to a customer email. Eg. based on sentiment, email will be write as positive/negative.
	Remind the model to use details from the customer's email. Eg. 

Chat bot:
	Till now, we are using role as user and message as prompt, this is for simple conversation. For chatbot, it will have multiple conversations, so roles will 
		be system, user, assistant, and message will be list of chat messages with role defined.
	Pizza Order Bot with give instruction as system prompt and interaction with user and assistant to order the pizza till payment.

Summary:
	Principles:
		Write clear and specific instructions.
		Give the model time to think.
	Iterative Prompt Development.
	Capabilities: Summary, Inferring, Transforming.
	Expanding.
	Chatbot.
