Assignment 2

Write a query to display the names of those students that are between the ages of 18 and 20.

select student_name
from students
where age >= 18 and age <= 20

or 

select student_name
from students
where age between 18 and 20

Write a query to display all of those students that contain the letters "ch" in their name or
 their name ends with the letters "nd".

select student_name
from students
where student_name like '%ch%'
or student_name like '%nd'

Write a query to display the name of those students that have the letters "ae" or "ph" in their name and
 are NOT 19 years old.

select student_name
from students
where (student_name like '%ae%' or student_name like '%ph%')
and age != 19

Write a query that lists the names of students sorted by their age from largest to smallest.

select student_name
from students
order by age desc

Write a query that displays the names and ages of the top 4 oldest students.

select student_name
from students
order by age desc
limit 4

ADVANCED:

Write a query that returns students based on the following criteria:
The student must not be older than age 20 if their student_no is either between 3 and 5 or their student_no is 7.
 Your query should also return students older than age 20 but in that case they must have a student_no 
 that is at least 4.

select *
from students
where ((student_no between 3 and 5
or student_no = 7) and age <= 20)
or (student_no >= 4 and age > 20)


Assignment 3

Write a query against the professors table that can output the following in the result:
 "Chong works in the Science department"

select last_name  || ' works in the ' || department || ' department'
from professors

Write a SQL query against the professors table that would return the following result:

"It is false that professor Chong is highly paid"
"It is true that professor Brown is highly paid"
"It is false that professor Jones is highly paid"
"It is true that professor Wilson is highly paid"
"It is false that professor Miller is highly paid"
"It is true that professor Williams is highly paid"

NOTE: A professor is highly paid if they make greater than 95000.

select 'It is '  || (salary > 95000) || ' that professor ' || last_name || ' is highly paid'
from professors

Write a query that returns all of the records and columns from the professors table but shortens
 the department names to only the first three characters in upper case.

select *, upper(substring(department,1,3))
from professors

select last_name, upper(substring(department,1,3)) as department, salary, hire_date
from professors

Write a query that returns the highest and lowest salary from the professors table excluding
 the professor named 'Wilson'.

select max(salary) Highest_salary,
min(salary) Lowest_salary
from professors
where last_name != 'Wilson'

Write a query that will display the hire date of the professor that has been teaching the longest.

select min(hire_date)
from professors

Assignment 4

Write a query that displays only the state with the largest amount of fruit supply.

select state
from fruit_imports
group by state
order by sum(supply) desc
limit 1

Write a query that returns the most expensive cost_per_unit of every season.
The query should display 2 columns, the season and the cost_per_unit

select season, max(cost_per_unit)
from fruit_imports
group by season

Write a query that returns the state that has more than 1 import of the same fruit.

select state
from fruit_imports
group by state, name
having count(name) > 1

Write a query that returns the seasons that produce either 3 fruits or 4 fruits.

select season, count(name)
from fruit_imports
group by season
having count(name) = 3 or count(name) = 4

Write a query that takes into consideration the supply and cost_per_unit columns for 
determining the total cost and returns the most expensive state with the total cost.

select max(a.total_cost)
from
(select state, sum((supply*cost_per_unit)) total_cost
from fruit_imports
group by state) a

or 

select state, sum((supply*cost_per_unit)) total_cost
from fruit_imports
group by state
order by total_cost desc
limit 1

Execute the below SQL script and answer the question that follows:

CREATE table fruits (fruit_name varchar(10));
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Orange');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Apple');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);

Write a query that returns the count of 4. You'll need to count on the column fruit_name and not use COUNT(*)

HINT: You'll need to use an additional function inside of count to make this work.

select count(coalesce(fruit_name, ''))
from fruits

Assignment 5

Is the students table directly related to the courses table? Why or why not?

No direct relation.

Using subqueries only, write a SQL statement that returns the names of those students that are taking the courses
 Physics and US History.

NOTE: Do not jump ahead and use joins. I want you to solve this problem using only what 
you've learned in this section.

select student_name
from students s
where s.student_no in
(select student_no
from student_enrollment e
where e.course_no in 
(select course_no
from courses
where course_title = 'Physics' 				where course_title in ('Physics', 'US History')
or course_title = 'US History'))

Using subqueries only, write a query that returns the name of the student that is taking the 
highest number of courses.

NOTE: Do not jump ahead and use joins. I want you to solve this problem using only what 
you've learned in this section.

select student_name
from students
where student_no in (
select student_no
from student_enrollment
group by student_no
order by count(course_no)
limit 1)

Answer TRUE or FALSE for the following statement:

Subqueries can be used in the FROM clause and the WHERE clause but cannot be used in the SELECT Clause.

False, It can used in select clause also.

Write a query to find the student that is the oldest. You are not allowed to use LIMIT or the ORDER BY 
clause to solve this problem.

select *
from students
where age = (select max(age)
from students)


Assignment 6

Write a query that displays 3 columns. The query should display the fruit and it's total supply along 
with a category of either LOW, ENOUGH or FULL. Low category means that the total supply of the fruit 
is less than 20,000. The enough category means that the total supply is between 20,000 and 50,000. 
If the total supply is greater than 50,000 then that fruit falls in the full category.

select name, sum(supply) total_supply,
case when sum(supply) < 20000 then 'LOW'
	 when sum(supply) between 20000 and 50000 then 'ENOUGH'
	 when sum(supply) > 50000 then 'FULL'
end category
from fruit_imports
group by name

Taking into consideration the supply column and the cost_per_unit column, you should be able to 
tabulate the total cost to import fruits by each season. The result will look something like this:

"Winter" "10072.50"
"Summer" "19623.00"
"All Year" "22688.00"
"Spring" "29930.00"
"Fall" "29035.00"

select season, 
sum(supply*cost_per_unit) total
from fruit_imports
group by season
order by total

Write a query that would transpose this data so that the seasons become columns and the total cost 
for each season fills the first row?

select
sum(case when season = 'Winter' then total end) as Winter_total,
sum(case when season = 'Summer' then total end) as Summer_total,
sum(case when season = 'Spring' then total end) as Spring_total,
sum(case when season = 'Fall' then total end) as Fall_total,
sum(case when season = 'All Year' then total end) as All_Year_total
from (select 
season, sum(supply*cost_per_unit) total
from fruit_imports
group by season) a

Assignment 7

Are the tables student_enrollment and professors directly related to each other? Why or why not?

Not directly related.

Write a query that shows the student's name, the courses the student is taking and the professors 
that teach that course.

select s.student_no, s.student_name, e.course_no, c.course_title, t.last_name
from students s 
join student_enrollment e
on s.student_no = e.student_no
join courses c
on e.course_no = c.course_no
join teach t
on e.course_no = t.course_no
order by student_name

or (both are giving same answers)

SELECT student_name, se.course_no, p.last_name
FROM students s
INNER JOIN student_enrollment se
    ON s.student_no = se.student_no
INNER JOIN teach t
    ON se.course_no = t.course_no
INNER JOIN professors p
    ON t.last_name = p.last_name
ORDER BY student_name;

If you execute the query from the previous answer, you'll notice the student_name and the course_no 
is being repeated. Why is this happening?

same course is taught by 2 professors. so student_name and course_no is repeating.

In question 3 you discovered why there is repeating data. How can we eliminate this redundancy? 
Let's say we only care to see a single professor teaching a course and we don't care for all the 
other professors that teach the particular course. Write a query that will accomplish this so that 
every record is distinct.

HINT: Using the DISTINCT keyword will not help. :-)

select student_name, course_no, min(last_name)
from (
select s.student_name, e.course_no, t.last_name
from students s 
join student_enrollment e
on s.student_no = e.student_no
join courses c
on e.course_no = c.course_no
join teach t
on e.course_no = t.course_no
order by student_name) a
group by student_name, course_no
order by student_name, course_no

Why are correlated subqueries slower that non-correlated subqueries and joins?

correlated subqueries runs, each row in inner queries for each row in outer queries. 
	so it takes lot of time to execute.

In the video lectures, we've been discussing the employees table and the departments table. 
Considering those tables,
write a query that returns employees whose salary is above average for their given department.

select e.first_name
from employees e, 
(select sum(salary) total_salary, round(avg(salary)) average_salary, department, count(employee_id) total_emp
from employees
group by department
order by count(employee_id)) f
where e.department = f.department
and e.salary > f.average_salary

both are same 

SELECT first_name
FROM employees outer_emp
WHERE salary > (
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE department = outer_emp.department);

Write a query that returns ALL of the students as well as any courses they may or may not be taking.

select s.student_no,student_name,course_no
from students s
left join student_enrollment e
on s.student_no = e.student_no

Challenging Puzzles For the Brave

Write a query that finds students who do not take CS180.

select *
from students
where student_no not in (
select student_no
from (
select s.student_no, student_name, course_no
from students s
left join student_enrollment se
on s.student_no = se.student_no) a
where course_no = 'CS180'
group by student_no)

both are correct

SELECT * FROM students
WHERE student_no NOT IN (
SELECT student_no
FROM student_enrollment
WHERE course_no = 'CS180'
);

these also correct

SELECT s.student_no, s.student_name, s.age
FROM students s LEFT JOIN student_enrollment se
ON s.student_no = se.student_no
GROUP BY s.student_no, s.student_name, s.age
HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN se.course_no = 'CS180'
THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0

Write a query to find students who take CS110 or CS107 but not both.

select *
from students
where student_no in (
select s.student_no
from students s
left join student_enrollment se
on s.student_no = se.student_no
where course_no in ('CS110','CS107')
group by s.student_no
having count(s.student_no) = 1)

both are correct. next one is little complicated

SELECT s.*
FROM students s, student_enrollment se
WHERE s.student_no = se.student_no
AND se.course_no IN ('CS110', 'CS107')
AND s.student_no NOT IN ( SELECT *
FROM student_enrollment a, student_enrollment b
WHERE a.student_no = b.student_no
AND a.course_no = 'CS110'
AND b.course_no = 'CS107')

this one also correct. but complicated

SELECT s.student_no, s.student_name, s.age
FROM students s, student_enrollment se
WHERE s.student_no = se.student_no
GROUP BY s.student_no, s.student_name, s.age
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN se.course_no IN ('CS110', 'CS107')
THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) = 1

Write a query to find students who take CS220 and no other courses.

select s.*
from students s
where s.student_no in 
(select student_no
from student_enrollment 
group by student_no
having count(course_no) = 1)
and s.student_no in
(select student_no
from student_enrollment
where course_no = 'CS220')

both are correct

SELECT s.*
FROM students s, student_enrollment se
WHERE s.student_no = se.student_no
AND s.student_no NOT IN ( SELECT student_no
FROM student_enrollment
WHERE course_no != 'CS220')

this also correct

SELECT s.*
FROM students s, student_enrollment se1,
(SELECT student_no FROM student_enrollment
GROUP BY student_no
HAVING count(*) = 1) se2
WHERE s.student_no = se1.student_no
AND se1.student_no = se2.student_no
AND se1.course_no = 'CS220'


Write a query that finds those students who take at most 2 courses. 
Your query should exclude students that don't take any courses as well as those that take more than 2 course.

select *
from students
where student_no in (
select student_no
from student_enrollment
group by student_no
having count(*) <= 2)

both are working

SELECT s.student_no, s.student_name, s.age
FROM students s, student_enrollment se
WHERE s.student_no = se.student_no
GROUP BY s.student_no, s.student_name, s.age
HAVING COUNT(*) <= 2

Write a query to find students who are older than at most two other students.

select *
from students
where student_no in (
select s1.student_no
from students s1,
students s2
where s1.age < s2.age
group by s1.student_no
having count(*) >= 4)

both are correct

SELECT s1.*
FROM students s1
WHERE 2 >= (SELECT count(*)
FROM students s2
WHERE s2.age < s1.age)

new changes done by me and working fine as expected

select *
from students
where student_no in (
SELECT s1.student_no
FROM students s1, students s2
WHERE s2.age < s1.age 
or (s2.age = s1.age
and s1.age in (select min(age) from students))
group by s1.student_no
having count(*) <= 2)
