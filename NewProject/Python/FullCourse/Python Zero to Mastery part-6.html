        <pre>Modules:
	Modules means holding many lines of codes, function to use
	  in another file.
	If there is 2 or more .py files and you want to run the
	  both files, then you need modules to connect these two.

	utility.py holds this method
	def multiply(num1, num2):
	  return num1*num2

	In main.py, import utility

	import utility
	print(utility.multiply(2, 3))		// 6

	__pychache__ is used by the module to store the cache data.
	which can rerun the program faster.

	modules can be accessed using . operator

Packages:
	Packages are used for even bigger files than Modules.
	Simply, Package is a folder which contains modules.

	If shopping folder contains shopping_cart.py files, then 
		shopping is a package, shopping_cart is module.

	In main.py, import all

	import utility
	import shopping.shopping_cart
	print(shopping.shopping_cart.buy(apple))	// apple

Different ways to import:
	If we have many folders inside one by one, then
	   we have to import folder.folder.folder.....file.
	It is very very long.

	from utility import multiply, divide
	from shopping.shopping_cart import buy
	print(buy(apple))				// apple

	we can also call many method using from import method.

	from utility import * 
	The above will return all the method from utility.py, 	
	  no need to call all of them one by one.

__name__:
	if __name__ == '__main__'

	print(__name__)		// prints name of file
	if print(__name__) is contained in folder	// prints folder
		structure.

	The file which runs as main file is considered as __main__.
	other files will print the folder name or file name.
	main file prints the __name__.

Built-in modules:
	There are many inbuilt modules in python.

	import random
	print(random.random())		// 0.541

	random is a inbuilt modules.

	print(random.choice([1,2,3,4,5]))	// 2

	we can also import module and rename it.
	import random as rd
	print(rd.random())		// 0.56

	import sys
	first = sys.argv[1]
	last = sys.argv[2]			
	print(f'hi {first} {last}')

	the sys.argv is used when we use terminal to open .py file.
	command is python3 name.py nik prime
	output:	hi nik prime

Package Index:
	pypi.org is a python package index.
	There are lot of packages and modules created by many
	  developer and shared to use in our files, no need to
 	    create each thing every time.

	
	In text-editors, we can install the packages like Pyjokes directly.
	But in terminal, it won't work bcoz it installed in text-editor
	  not in python file.
	When run in terminal, we need to install the module.

	in terminal, pip3 -V   		// it show the version of pip
	pip3 install pyjokes		// it install the pyjokes packages


	To upgrade pip, pip3 install --upgrade pip
	pip3 list 	// show the list of pakages that we have.

	pip3 unistall pyjokes		// it uninstall pyjokes
	
	if you want to use the latest version, uninstall the older version
	  then install newer version using pip3 install pyjokes

	if you want to older version for specific reason, 
	  pip3 install pyjokes==0.4.0

	But the latest version is 0.5.0
	Because sometimes we use the older version, 2 or 3 years ago,
	  now it may be updated. if we rerun the code, we need old version.

Virtual Environments:
	Virtual Environment is like a new world, which doesnot have the
	  package or module we have installed in text-editor or terminal.

	In companies, we always use virtual environments as venv.

Useful Modules:
	from collections import Counter, defaultdict, OrderedDict

	// in these some are function and methods.

	li = [1,2,3,4,5,5,5]
	print(Counter(li))	//({5:3, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1})

	dictionary = {'a':1, 'b':2}
	print(dictionary['a'])		// 1
	print(dictionary['c'])		// error

	dictionary = defaultdict(int, {'a':1, 'b':2})
	print(dictionary['c'])		// 0

	dictionary = defaultdict(lambda: 5, {'a':1, 'b':2})
	print(dictionary['c'])		// 5

	dictionary = defaultdict(lambda: 'hi', {'a':1, 'b':2})
	print(dictionary['c'])		// hi

	d = OrderedDict()
	d['a'] = 1
	d['b'] = 2
	d2 = OrderedDict()
	d['b'] = 2
	d['a'] = 1
	print(d2 == d)			// False

	d = {'c': 100}
	d['a'] = 1
	d['b'] = 2
	d2 = {'c': 100}
	d['b'] = 2
	d['a'] = 1
	print(d2 == d)			// True

Useful Module 2:
	import datetime
	print(datetime.time())		// 00:00:00
	print(datetime.time(5,12,9))	// 05:12:09
	print(datetime.date.today())	// 2020-09-30

	from array import array
	array('i',[1,2,3])
	i denotes the integer as it used as typecode in array,
	  check the documentation in array.
