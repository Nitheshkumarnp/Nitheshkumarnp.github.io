        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing programming logic that can access data and use it to learn for themselves by focusing on analyzing and interpreting patterns and structures in data to enable learning, reasoning, and decision making which can't be done by human interaction.</p>

        <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Supervised Learning</li>
            <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
            <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is Supervised Learning?</h2>
        <p>Supervised machine learning learns patterns and relationships between input and output data. It is defined by its use of labeled data. A labeled data is a dataset that contains a lot of examples of Features and Target. Supervised learning uses algorithms that learn the relationship of Features and Target from the dataset.</p>
        <p>Supervised learning further falls into two groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regression</li>
            <li>Classification</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is Unsupervised Learning?</h2>
        <p>Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using a training dataset. Instead, models find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the human brain while learning new things. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using an unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.</p>

        <h2>What is Reinforcement Learning?</h2>
        <p>Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and seeing the results of those actions. For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, the agent gets negative feedback or a penalty.</p>

        <h2>How Supervised Learning works?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Machine Learning algorithm here is provided with a small training dataset to work with, which is a smaller part of the bigger dataset.</li>
            <li>It serves to give the algorithm an idea of the problem, solution, and various data points to be dealt with.</li>
            <li>The training dataset here is also very similar to the final dataset in its characteristics and offers the algorithm the labeled parameters required for the problem.</li>
            <li>The Machine Learning algorithm then finds relationships between the given parameters, establishing a cause and effect relationship between the variables in the dataset.</li>
        </ul>
