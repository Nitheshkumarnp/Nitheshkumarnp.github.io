        <h2>what is variance in cluster? (KMeans Algorithm)</h2>
        <li>Variance in clustering refers to the measure of how much the data points within a cluster differ from the cluster's centroid (or center). It helps us understand how tightly packed or spread out the data points are within each cluster.</li>
        <li>Low Variance: If a cluster has low variance, the data points are close to each other and to the centroid. This indicates a tight, well-defined cluster.</li>
        <li>High Variance: If a cluster has high variance, the data points are spread out over a larger area, meaning the cluster is more dispersed and less tightly grouped.</li>
        <li>When evaluating clustering performance, lower variance within clusters is generally preferred because it indicates that the clusters are more distinct and the data points within each cluster are more similar to each other.</li>
        
        <h2>what is Silhouette Score in cluster? (KMeans Algorithm)</h2>
        <p>The Silhouette Score is a way to measure how well data points have been clustered. It tells you how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.</p>
        <li><b>a</b>: The average distance from the data point to all other points in the same cluster.</li>
        <li><b>b</b>: The average distance from the data point to all points in the nearest (but different) cluster.</li>
        <li><b>Silhouette Score (s)</b>: Calculated as s = b-a / max(a,b)</li>
        <p>Scores:</p>
        <li><b>High Silhouette Score (close to +1)</b>: Indicates that the data point is well matched to its own cluster and distinct from other clusters.</li>
        <li><b>Low Silhouette Score (close to 0)</b>: Indicates that the data point is on the boundary of two clusters.</li>
        <li><b>Negative Silhouette Score (close to -1)</b>: Indicates that the data point might be in the wrong cluster.</li>
