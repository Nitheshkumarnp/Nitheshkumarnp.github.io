        <h1>Statistics Concepts</h1>
        
        <h2>What is Statistics?</h2>
        <p>Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves the use of various techniques and methods to gather, summarize, and draw conclusions from data in order to make informed decisions or draw reliable conclusions about a population based on a sample.</p>
  
        <h2>Types of Statistics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Descriptive Statistics</li>
            <li>Inferential Statistics</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Subfields and Specialized Branches</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Probability theory</li>
            <li>Statistical inference</li>
            <li>Hypothesis testing</li>
            <li>Regression analysis</li>
            <li>Time series analysis</li>
            <li>Experimental design</li>
            <li>Multivariate analysis</li>
            <li>Bayesian statistics</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>What is Probability?</h2>
        <p>Probability is a measure or quantification of the likelihood or chance that a particular event will occur. It is a fundamental concept in statistics and mathematics, used to model and analyze uncertainty in various situations.</p>
  
        <h2>Interpretations of Probability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Classical Probability</li>
            <li>Subjective Probability</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Probability Theory Tools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Addition rule</li>
            <li>Multiplication rule</li>
            <li>Conditional probability</li>
            <li>Bayes' theorem</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Addition Rule in Probability</h2>
        <p>The addition rule in probability states that the probability of the occurrence of either of two mutually exclusive events is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.</p>
  
        <h2>Multiplication Rule in Probability</h2>
        <p>The multiplication rule in probability is used to calculate the probability of the joint occurrence of two independent events. It states that the probability of both events A and B occurring is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.</p>
