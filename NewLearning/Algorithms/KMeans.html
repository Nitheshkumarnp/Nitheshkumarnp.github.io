        <h1>K Means</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>KMeans clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets or clusters.</p>
        <p>It involves grouping similar data points together based on their features or characteristics.</p>
        <p>The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates the cluster centroids until convergence.</p>
        <p>The goal is to minimize the variance within each cluster.</p>
        <p>It aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, which measures the squared distance between each data point and its assigned centroid.</p>
  
        <h2>Differences from Other Clustering Algorithms:</h2>
        <p>Unlike hierarchical clustering which creates a tree of clusters, KMeans requires the number of clusters to be specified in advance.</p>
        <p>The algorithm is also sensitive to the initial centroid positions and can converge to suboptimal solutions. Extensions like K-means++ initialization and careful selection of k can help mitigate these issues.</p>
        <p>It is also more computationally efficient for large datasets compared to some other algorithms like DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering.</p>

        <h2>Mathematical Concepts:</h2>
        <p>The objective function in KMeans is to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and the centroid of its assigned cluster.</p>
        <p>Euclidean Distance: The distance between two points x and y in Euclidean space. This distance metric is used in KMeans to measure the similarity between points and centroids.</p>
