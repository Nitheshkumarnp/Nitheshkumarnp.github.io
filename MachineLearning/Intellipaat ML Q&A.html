        <h3><strong>1. Explain Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning</strong></h3>
        <p>It is common to get confused between the three in-demand technologies, Machine Learning, Artificial
            Intelligence,
            and Deep Learning. These three technologies, though a little different from one another, are interrelated.
            While
            Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
            Since
            some terms and techniques may overlap in these technologies, it is easy to get confused among them.</p>

                    Learning</a>: Deep Learning comprises several algorithms that enable software to learn from
                themselves
                and perform various business tasks including image and speech recognition. Deep Learning is possible
                when
                systems expose their multilayered neural networks to large volumes of data for learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>2. What is Bias and Variance in Machine Learning?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bias is the difference between
                    the
                    average prediction of a model and the correct value of the model. If the bias value is high, then
                    the
                    prediction of the model is not accurate. Hence, the bias value should be as low as possible to make
                    the
                    desired predictions.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Variance is the number that
                    gives
                    the difference of prediction over a training set and the anticipated value of other training sets.
                    High
                    variance may lead to large fluctuation in the output. Therefore, a model’s output should have low
                    variance.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following diagram shows the bias-variance trade-off:</span></p>

        <h3><strong>3. What is Clustering in Machine Learning?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clustering is a technique used in unsupervised learning that involves
                grouping
                data points. The clustering algorithm can be used with a set of data points. This technique will allow
                you
                to classify all data points into their particular groups. The data points that are thrown into the same
                category have similar features and properties, while the data points that belong to different groups
                have
                distinct features and properties. Statistical data analysis can be performed by this method. Let us take
                a
                look at three of the most popular and useful clustering algorithms.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">K-means clustering: This
                    algorithm
                    is commonly used when there is data with no specific group or category. K-means clustering allows
                    you to
                    find the hidden patterns in the data, which can be used to classify the data into various groups.
                    The
                    variable </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">k</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is
                    used
                    to represent the number of groups the data is divided into, and the data points are clustered using
                    the
                    similarity of features. Here, the centroids of the clusters are used for labeling new data.</span>
            </li>
            <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mean-shift clustering: The main aim of this algorithm is
                    to
                    update the center-point candidates to be mean and find the center points of all groups. In
                    mean-shift
                    clustering, unlike k-means clustering, the possible number of clusters need not be selected as it
                    can
                    automatically be discovered by the mean shift.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Density-based spatial
                    clustering of
                    applications with noise (DBSCAN): This clustering algorithm is based on density and has similarities
                    with mean-shift clustering. There is no need to preset the number of clusters, but unlike mean-shift
                    clustering, DBSCAN identifies outliers and treats them like noise. Moreover, it can identify
                    arbitrarily-sized and -shaped clusters without much effort.</span></li>

        <h3><strong>6. What is Overfitting in Machine Learning and how can it be avoided?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>Overfitting happens when a machine has an inadequate dataset and tries to learn from it. So, overfitting is
            inversely proportional to the amount of data.</p>
        <p>For small databases, overfitting can be bypassed by the cross-validation method. In this approach, a dataset
            is
            divided into two sections. These two sections will comprise the testing and training dataset. To train a
            model,
            the training dataset is used, and for testing the model for new inputs, the testing dataset is used.<br />
            This is how to avoid overfitting.</p>
        <div id="7" class="padTop"></div>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>7. What is Hypothesis in Machine Learning?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning allows the use of available dataset to understand a specific
                function that maps input to output in the best possible way. This problem is known as function
                approximation. Here, approximation needs to be used for the unknown target function that maps all
                plausible
                observations based on the given problem in the best manner. Hypothesis in Machine learning is a model
                that
                helps in approximating the target function and performing the necessary input-to-output mappings. The
                choice
                and configuration of algorithms allow defining the space of plausible hypotheses that may be represented
                by
                a model.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hypothesis, lowercase h (h) is used for a specific hypothesis, while
                uppercase h (H) is used for the hypothesis space that is being searched. Let us briefly understand these
                notations:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypothesis (h): A hypothesis is
                    a
                    specific model that helps in mapping input to output; the mapping can further be used for evaluation
                    and
                    prediction.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypothesis set (H): Hypothesis
                    set
                    consists of a space of hypotheses that can be used to map inputs to outputs, which can be searched.
                    The

            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep Learning: Deep Learning
                    allows
                    machines to make various business-related decisions using artificial neural networks, which is one
                    of
                    the reasons why it needs a vast amount of data for training. Since there is a lot of computing power
                    required, Deep Learning requires high-end systems as well. The systems acquire various properties
                    and
                    features with the help of the given data, and the problem is solved using an end-to-end
                    method.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning: Machine
                    Learning
                    gives machines the ability to make business decisions without any external help, using the knowledge
                    gained from past data. Machine Learning systems require relatively small amounts of data to train
                    themselves, and most of the features need to be manually coded and understood in advance. In Machine
                    Learning, a given business problem is dissected into two and then solved individually. Once the
                    solutions of both have been acquired, they are then combined.</span></li>

        <h3><strong>9. What are the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supervised learning: The
                    algorithms
                    of supervised learning use labeled data to get trained. The models take direct feedback to confirm
                    whether the output that is being predicted is, indeed, correct. Moreover, both the input data and
                    the
                    output data are provided to the model, and the main aim here is to train the model to predict the
                    output
                    upon receiving new data. Supervised learning offers accurate results and can largely be divided into
                    two
                    parts, classification and regression.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsupervised learning: The
                    algorithms of unsupervised learning use unlabeled data for training purposes. In unsupervised
                    learning,
                    the models identify hidden data trends and do not take any feedback. The unsupervised learning model
                    is
                    only provided with input data. Unsupervised learning’s main aim is to identify hidden patterns to
                    extract information from unknown sets of data. It can also be classified into two parts, clustering,
                    and
                    associations. Unfortunately, unsupervised learning offers results that are comparatively less
                    accurate.</span></li>

        <h3><strong>10. What is Bayes’s Theorem in Machine Learning?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>Bayes’s theorem offers the probability of any given event to occur using prior knowledge. In mathematical
            terms,
            it can be defined as the true positive rate of the given sample condition divided by the sum of the true
            positive rate of the said condition and the false positive rate of the entire population.</p>
        <p>Two of the most significant applications of Bayes’s theorem in Machine Learning are Bayesian optimization and
            Bayesian belief networks. This theorem is also the foundation behind the Machine Learning brand that
            involves
            the Naive Bayes classifier.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of PCA is to find a fresh collection of uncorrelated dimensions
                (orthogonal) and rank them on the basis of variance.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mechanism of PCA:</span></p>

        <h3><strong>13. What is Cross-validation in Machine Learning?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-validation allows a system to increase the performance of the given
                Machine
                Learning algorithm, which is fed a number of sample data from the dataset. This sampling process is done
                to
                break the dataset into smaller parts that have the same number of rows, out of which a random part is
                selected as a test set and the rest of the parts are kept as train sets. Cross-validation consists of
                the
                following techniques:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holdout method</span></li>

        <h3><strong>14. What is Entropy in Machine Learning?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>Entropy in Machine Learning measures the randomness in the data that needs to be processed. The more entropy
            in
            the given data, the more difficult it becomes to draw any useful conclusion from the data. For example, let
            us
            take the flipping of a coin. The result of this act is random as it does not favor heads or tails. Here, the
            result for any number of tosses cannot be predicted easily as there is no definite relationship between the
            action of flipping and the possible outcomes.</p>

        <p><a href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/epoch-in-machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epoch in
                Machine
                Learning</a> is used to indicate the count of passes in a given training dataset where the Machine
            Learning
            algorithm has done its job. Generally, when there is a large chunk of data, it is grouped into several
            batches.
            All these batches go through the given model, and this process is referred to as iteration. Now, if the
            batch
            size comprises the complete training dataset, then the count of iterations is the same as that of
            epochs.<br />
            In case there is more than one batch, d*e=i*b is the formula used, wherein d is the dataset, e is the number
            of
            epochs, i is the number of iterations, and b is the batch size.</p>

            data
            and makes clusters of similar entities. After that, when a new input data is fed into the model, it does not

        <h3><strong>17. Differentiate between Classification and Regression in Machine Learning</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Machine Learning, there are various types of prediction problems based on
                supervised and unsupervised learning. They are classification, regression, clustering, and association.
                Here, we will discuss classification and regression.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classification: In </span><a
                href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/machine-learning-tutorial/classification-machine-learning/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">classification</span></a><span
                style="font-weight: 400;">, a Machine Learning model is created that assists in differentiating data
                into
                separate categories. The data is labeled and categorized based on the input parameters.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, predictions have to be made on the churning out customers for a
                particular product based on some recorded data. Either the customers will churn out or they will not.
                So,
                the labels for this would be “Yes” and “No.”</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regression: It is the process of creating a model for distinguishing data
                into
                continuous real values, instead of using classes or discrete values. It can also identify the
                distribution
                movement depending on historical data. It is used for predicting the occurrence of an event depending on
                the
                degree of association of variables.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the prediction of weather conditions depends on factors such as
                temperature, air pressure, solar radiation, elevation, and distance from the sea. The relation among
                these
                factors assists in predicting the weather condition.</span></p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>18. How is the suitability of a Machine Learning Algorithm determined for a particular
                problem?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To identify a </span><a
                href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/machine-learning-tutorial/machine-learning-algorithms/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning
                    Algorithm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a particular problem, the following steps
                should be followed:</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Problem classification: Classification of the
                problem
                depends on the classification of input and output:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classifying the input:
                    Classification of the input depends on whether there is data labeled (supervised learning) or
                    unlabeled
                    (unsupervised learning), or whether a model has to be created that interacts with the environment
                    and
                    improves itself (reinforcement learning.)</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classifying the output: If the
                    output of a model is required as a class, then some classification techniques need to be
                    used.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the output is a number, then regression techniques must be used; if the
                output
                is a different cluster of inputs, then clustering techniques should be used.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Checking the algorithms in hand: After classifying
                the
                problem, the available algorithms that can be deployed for solving the classified problem should be
                considered.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Implementing the algorithms: If there are multiple
                algorithms available, then all of them are to be implemented. Finally, the algorithm that gives the best
                performance is selected.</span></p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>19. What is the Variance Inflation Factor?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Variance inflation factor (VIF) is the estimate of the volume of
                multicollinearity in a collection of many regression variables.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VIF = Variance of the model / Variance of the model with a single independent
                variable</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ratio has to be calculated for every independent variable. If VIF is
                high,
                then it shows the high collinearity of the independent variables.</span></p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>20. What is a Confusion Matrix?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><a href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/confusion-matrix-python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">Confusion matrix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is used to
                explain
                a model’s performance and gives a summary of predictions of the classification problems. It assists in
                identifying the uncertainty between classes.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confusion matrix gives the count of correct and incorrect values and error
                types.
                Accuracy of the model: </span></p>
        <p><img class="size-full wp-image-206922 aligncenter"
                src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=' http://www.w3.org/2000/svg '%20viewBox=' 0%200%20602%20134 '%3E%3C/svg%3E"
                alt="Accuracy of the model" width="602" height="134"
                data-lazy-src="https://intellipaat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Accuracy-of-the-model.png" /><noscript><img
                    class="size-full wp-image-206922 aligncenter"
                    src="https://intellipaat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Accuracy-of-the-model.png"
                    alt="Accuracy of the model" width="602" height="134" /></noscript></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, consider the following confusion matrix. It consists of values
                as
                true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative for a classification model. Now, the
                accuracy of the model can be calculated as follows:</span></p>
        <p><img class="size-full wp-image-206923 aligncenter"
                src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=' http://www.w3.org/2000/svg '%20viewBox=' 0%200%20602%20165 '%3E%3C/svg%3E"
                alt="What is a Confusion Matrix" width="602" height="165"
                data-lazy-src="https://intellipaat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/What-is-a-Confusion-Matrix.png" /><noscript><img
                    class="size-full wp-image-206923 aligncenter"
                    src="https://intellipaat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/What-is-a-Confusion-Matrix.png"
                    alt="What is a Confusion Matrix" width="602" height="165" /></noscript></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in the example:</span></p>
        <pre>Accuracy = (200 + 50) / (200 + 50 + 10 + 60) = 0.78</pre>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that the model’s accuracy is 0.78, corresponding to its True
                Positive,
                True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative values.</span></p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>21. What are Type I and Type II Errors?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><b>Type I Error:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Type I Error, false positive, is an error where the
                outcome
                of a test shows the nonacceptance of a true condition.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, suppose a person gets diagnosed with depression even when they
                are
                not suffering from the same, it is a case of false positive.</span></p>
        <p><b>Type II Error:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Type II Error, false negative, is an error where the
                outcome of a test shows the acceptance of a false condition.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the CT scan of a person shows that they do not have a disease
                but in
                fact they do have the disease. Here, the test accepts the false condition that the person does not have
                the
                disease. This is a case of false negative.</span></p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>22. When should Classification be used over Regression?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>Both classification and regression are associated with prediction. Classification involves the identification
            of
            values or entities that lie in a specific group. Regression entails predicting a response value from
            consecutive
            sets of outcomes.</p>
        <p>Classification is chosen over regression when the output of the model needs to yield the belongingness of
            data
            points in a dataset to a particular category.</p>
        <p>For example, If you want to predict the price of a house, you should use regression since it is a numerical
            variable. However, if you are trying to predict whether a house situated in a particular area is going to be
            high-, medium-, or low-priced, then a classification model should be used.</p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>23. Explain Logistic Regression</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><a href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-logistic-regression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">Logistic regression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the
                proper
                regression analysis used when the dependent variable is categorical or binary. Like all regression
                analyses,
                logistic regression is a technique for </span><a
                href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-predictive-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">predictive analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Logistic
                regression is used to explain data and the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or
                more independent variables. Logistic regression is also employed to predict the probability of
                categorical
                dependent variables.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logistic regression can be used in the following scenarios:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To predict whether a citizen is
                    a
                    Senior Citizen (1) or not (0)</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To check whether a person has a
                    disease (Yes) or not (No)</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three types of logistic regression:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binary logistic regression: In
                    this
                    type of logistic regression, there are only two outcomes possible.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: To predict whether it will rain (1) or not (0)</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multinomial logistic
                    regression: In
                    this type of logistic regression, the output consists of three or more unordered categories.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Predicting whether the prize of the house is high, medium, or
                low.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinal logistic regression: In
                    this type of logistic regression, the output consists of three or more ordered categories.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Rating an Android application from one to five stars.</span></p>

        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">isNull(): It can be used for

            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropna(): It can be used for
                    removing columns or rows with null values.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">fillna() can be used to fill the void values with placeholder values.</span>

        <h3><strong>25. Why is rotation required in PCA? What will happen if the components are not rotated?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <p>Rotation is a significant step in principal component analysis (PCA.) Rotation maximizes the separation
            within
            the variance obtained by the components. This makes the interpretation of the components easier.</p>
        <p>The motive behind conducting PCA is to choose fewer components that can explain the greatest variance in a
            dataset. When rotation is performed, the original coordinates of the points get changed. However, there is
            no
            change in the relative position of the components.</p>
        <p>If the components are not rotated, then there needs to be more extended components to describe the variance.

        <h3><strong>26. What is ROC Curve and what does it represent?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ROC stands for receiver operating characteristic. </span><a
                href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/roc-curve-in-machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">ROC Curve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is used to
                graphically
                represent the trade-off between true and false-positive rates.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In ROC, the area under the curve (AUC) gives an idea about the accuracy of
                the
                model.</span></p>

        <p>The above graph shows a ROC curve. The greater the AUC, the better the performance of the model.</p>
        <p>Next, we will be taking a look at Machine Learning interview questions on rescaling, binarizing, and
            standardizing.</p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>27. Why are Validation and Test Datasets Needed?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is split into three different categories while creating a model:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Training dataset:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                    Training
                    dataset is used for building a model and adjusting its variables. The correctness of the model built
                    on
                    the training dataset cannot be relied on as the model might give incorrect outputs after being fed
                    new
                    inputs.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Validation dataset:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"> Validation dataset is used to look into a model’s response. After
                        this,
                        the hyperparameters on the basis of the estimated benchmark of the validation dataset data are
                        tuned.</span></span>When a model’s response is evaluated by using the validation dataset, the
                model
                is indirectly trained with the validation set. This may lead to the overfitting of the model to specific
                data. So, this model will not be strong enough to give the desired response to real-world data.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Test dataset:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"> Test dataset is the subset of the actual dataset, which is not yet
                        used
                        to train the model. The model is unaware of this dataset. So, by using the test dataset, the
                        response of the created model can be computed on hidden data. The model’s performance is tested
                        on
                        the basis of the test dataset.</span></span>Note: The model is always exposed to the test
                dataset
                after tuning the hyperparameters on top of the validation dataset.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As we know, the evaluation of the model on the basis of the validation dataset would not be enough. Thus, the
            test dataset is used for computing the efficiency of the model.</p>
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>28. Explain the difference between KNN and K-means Clustering</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><b>K-nearest neighbors (KNN):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is a supervised Machine Learning
                algorithm.
                In KNN, identified or labeled data is given to the model. The model then matches the points based on the
                distance from the closest points.</span></p>

        </p>
        <h3><strong>29. What is Dimensionality Reduction?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>In the real world, Machine Learning models are built on top of features and parameters. These features can be
            multidimensional and large in number. Sometimes, the features may be irrelevant and it becomes a difficult
            task
            to visualize them.</p>
        <p>This is where dimensionality reduction is used to cut down irrelevant and redundant features with the help of
            principal variables. These principal variables conserve the features, and are a subgroup, of the parent
            variables.</p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>30. Both being Tree-based Algorithms, how is Random Forest different from Gradient Boosting Machine
                (GBM)?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main difference between a random forest and GBM is the use of techniques.
            </span><a href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-random-forest-algorithm-in-python/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Random forest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                advances predictions using a technique called bagging. On the other hand, GBM advances predictions with
                the
                help of a technique called boosting.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bagging:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In bagging, we
                    apply arbitrary sampling and we divide the dataset into </span><i><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">N.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After that, we build a
                    model
                    by employing a single training algorithm. Following that, we combine the final predictions by
                    polling.
                    Bagging helps to increase the efficiency of a model by decreasing the variance to eschew
                    overfitting.</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Boosting:</b> In boosting, the algorithm tries to review and
                correct the inadmissible predictions at the initial iteration. After that, the algorithm’s sequence of
                iterations for correction continues until we get the desired prediction. Boosting assists in reducing
                bias
                and variance for strengthening the weak learners.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>31. What is meant by Parametric and Non-parametric Models?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>Parametric models refer to the models having a limited number of parameters. In case of parametric models,
            only
            the parameter of a model is needed to be known to make predictions regarding the new data.</p>
        <p>Non-parametric models do not have any restrictions on the number of parameters, which makes new data
            predictions
            more flexible. In case of non-parametric models, the knowledge of model parameters and the state of the data
            needs to be known to make predictions.</p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>32. Differentiate between Sigmoid and Softmax Functions</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>Sigmoid and Softmax functions differ based on their usage in Machine Learning task classification. Sigmoid
            function is used in the case of binary classification, while Softmax function is used in case of
            multi-classification.</p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>33. In Machine Learning, for how many classes can Logistic Regression be used?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>Logistic regression cannot be used for more than two classes. Logistic regression is, by default, a binary
            classifier. However, in cases where multi-class classification problems need to be solved, the default
            number of
            classes can be extended, i.e., multinomial logistic regression.</p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>34. What do you understand about the P-value?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>P-value is used in decision-making while testing a hypothesis. The null hypothesis is rejected at the minimum
            significance level of the P-value. A lower P-value indicates that the null hypothesis is to be rejected.</p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>35. What is meant by Correlation and Covariance?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>Correlation is a mathematical concept used in statistics and probability theory to measure, estimate, and
            compare
            data samples taken from different populations. In simpler terms, correlation helps in establishing a
            quantitative relationship between two variables.</p>
        <p>Covariance is also a mathematical concept; it is a simpler way to arrive at a correlation between two
            variables.
            Covariance basically helps in determining what change or affect does one variable has on another.</p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>36. What are the Various Tests for Checking the Normality of a Dataset?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Machine Learning, checking the normality of a dataset is very important.
                Hence, certain tests are performed on a dataset to check its normality. Some of them are:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">D’Agostino Skewness Test</span>

            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>37. What are the Two Main Types of Filtering in Machine Learning? Explain.</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two types of filtering are:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborative filtering</span>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content-based filtering</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborative filtering refers to a recommender system where the interests of
                the
                individual user are matched with preferences of multiple users to predict new content.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content-based filtering is a recommender system where the focus is only on
                the
                preferences of the individual user and not on multiple users. </span></p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>38. Outlier Values can be Discovered from which Tools?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>The various tools that can be used to discover outlier values are scatterplots, boxplots, Z-score, etc.</p>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>39. What is meant by Ensemble Learning?</strong></h3>
        <p>
        <p>Ensemble learning refers to the combination of multiple Machine Learning models to create more powerful
            models.
            The primary techniques involved in ensemble learning are bagging and boosting.</p>

        <p>
        <p>In real-world scenarios, the attributes present in data are in a varying pattern. So, rescaling the
            characteristics to a common scale is beneficial for algorithms to process data efficiently.</p>

        <p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Converting data into binary values on the basis of threshold values is known
                as
                binarizing of data. The values that are less than the threshold are set to 0 and the values that are
                greater
                than the threshold are set to 1. This process is useful when feature engineering has to be performed.
                This
                can also be used for adding unique features.</span>

                doesn’t.
                How?</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">When one-hot encoding is used, there is an increase in the dimensionality of
                a
                dataset. The reason for the increase in dimensionality is that every class in categorical variables,
                forms a
                different variable.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Suppose there is a variable “Color.” It has three sublevels,
                “Yellow,”
                “Purple,” and “Orange.” So, one-hot encoding “Color” will create three different variables as
                Color.Yellow,
                Color.Purple, and Color.Orange.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">In label encoding, the subclasses of a certain variable get the value 0 and
                1.
                So, label encoding is only used for binary variables.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why one-hot encoding increases the dimensionality of data and label

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Gini index, if we arbitrarily pick a pair of objects from a
