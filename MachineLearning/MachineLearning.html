                <h4>What is Machine Learning?</h4>
                <p>Machine learning is an subset of AI that enables machine to learn and improve from 
                    experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing 
                    programming logic that can access data and use it to learn for themselves by focuses on 
                    analyzing and interpreting patterns and structures in data to enable learning, reasoning,
                    and decision making which can't be done by human interaction.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Types of Machine Learning?</h4>
                <p>* Supervised Learning<br>* Unsupervised Learning<br>* Reinforcement Learning</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What is Supervised Learning?</h4>
                <p>Supervised machine learning learns patterns and relationships between input and output 
                    data. It is defined by its use of labeled data. A labeled data is a dataset that contains 
                    a lot of examples of Features and Target. Supervised learning uses algorithms that learn 
                    the relationship of Features and Target from the dataset.</p>
                <p>Supervised learning further falls into two groups:</p>
                <p>* Regression<br>* Classification</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What is Unsupervised Learning?</h4>
                <p>Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised 
                    using training dataset. Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from 
                    the given data. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the human brain while 
                    learning new things.<br>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which 
                    models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without 
                    any supervision.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What is Reinforcement Learning?</h4>
                <p>Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent 
                    learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of 
                    actions. For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, 
                    the agent gets negative feedback or penalty.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>How Supervised Learning works?</h4>
                <p> * The Machine Learning algorithm here is provided with a small training dataset to work 
                    with, which is a smaller part of the bigger dataset.<br>
                    * It serves to give the algorithm an idea of the problem, solution, and various data points 
                    to be dealt with.<br>
                    * The training dataset here is also very similar to the final dataset in its characteristics 
                    and offers the algorithm with the labeled parameters required for the problem.<br>
                    * The Machine Learning algorithm then finds relationships between the given parameters, 
                    establishing a cause and effect relationship between the variables in the dataset</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>How Unsupervised Learning works?</h4>
                <p> * Since unsupervised learning does not have any labels to work off, it creates hidden 
                    structures.<br>
                    * Relationships between data points are then perceived by the algorithm randomly or 
                    abstractly, with absolutely no input required from human beings.<br>
                    * Instead of a specific, defined, and set problem statement, unsupervised learning 
                    algorithms can adapt to the data by changing hidden structures dynamically.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>How Reinforcement Learning works?</h4>
                <p> * Reinforcement learning features a machine learning algorithm that improves upon itself.<br>
                    * It typically learns by trial and error to achieve a clear objective.<br>
                    * In this Machine Learning algorithm, favorable outputs are reinforced or encouraged, 
                    whereas non-favorable outputs are discouraged.</p>

                <h4>Problems solved by ML?</h4>
                <p>* Identifying Spam<br> * Forecasting<br> * Customer Segmentation<br>
                   * Image & Video Recognition<br> * Fraudulent Transactions<br> * Demand Forecasting<br>
                   * Virtual Personal Assistant<br> * Sentiment Analysis<br> * Making Product Recommendations</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?</h4>
                <p>The difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear 
                regression output is the continuous value that can be anything while logistic 
                regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or 
                not.<br><br>Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems, whereas 
                Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>What is R-squared score?</h4>
                <p>R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the 
                variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable in a 
                regression model.<br>* If R^2 is 1, then our regression line connects all points.
                <br> * If R^2 is 0, then our regression line not connected with any points and 
                error are high. <br>* Good fitness of R^2 values should be above 0.6</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Probability vs Odds:</h4>
                <p>Probability mean success / total attempt.<br>Odds mean success / failed.<br>
                <b>Eg.</b> In summer day, catching 2 fishes in 5 days. in winter day, catching 
                3 fishes in 5 days.<br>
                * prob = 2/5 in summer, prob = 3/5 in winter.<br>
                * odds = 2/3 in summer, odds = 3/2 in winter.<br></p>

              <div>
                <h4>Evaluation Metrics for Regression: </h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RMSE</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>What is Mean Squared Error(MSE)?</h4>
                <p>The MSE is calculated as the mean or average of the squared differences 
            between predicted and expected target values in a dataset.<br>It is also an 
            important loss function for algorithms fit or optimized using the least squares 
            framing of a regression problem.<br>we perform squared to avoid the cancellation 
            of negative terms and it is the benefit of MSE.</p>
            <p><b>Advantages:</b><br>* The graph of MSE is differentiable, so you can easily 
            use it as a loss function.</p>
            <p><b>Disadvantages:</b><br>* The value you get after calculating MSE is a squared unit 
            of output. for example, the output variable is in meter(m) then after calculating 
            MSE the output we get is in meter squared.<br>
            * If you have outliers in the dataset then it penalizes the outliers most and the 
            calculated MSE is bigger. So, in short, It is not Robust to outliers which were 
            an advantage in MAE.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)?</h4>
            <p>* It is square of RME.<br>* The square root of the error is calculated, which means that the units of the 
            RMSE are the same as the original units of the target value that is being 
            predicted.<br>* A perfect RMSE value is 0.0, which means that all predictions 
            matched the expected values exactly.<br>
            <b>Advantage: </b>The output value you get is in the same unit as the required 
            output variable which makes interpretation of loss easy.<br>
            <b>Disadvantage: </b>It is not that robust to outliers as compared to MAE.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is Mean Absolute Error(MAE)?</h4>
            <p>MAE is a very simple metric which calculates the absolute difference between 
            actual and predicted values.<br><b>Advantage: </b><br>* The MAE you get is in the same 
            unit as the output variable.<br>
            * It is most Robust to outliers.<br>
            <b>Disadvantage:</b> The graph of MAE is not differentiable so we have to apply 
            various optimizers like Gradient descent which can be differentiable.</p>

            <h4>Evaluation Metrics for classification: </h4>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confusion Matrix<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precision<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall/Sensitivity<br>

            ROC AUC curve</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is Confusion Matrix?</h4>
            <p>Confusion Matrix is a performance measurement for the machine learning 
            classification problems where the output can be two or more classes. It is a 
            table with combinations of predicted and actual values.<br>A confusion matrix 
            is defined as the table that is often used to describe the performance of a 
            classification model on a set of the test data for which the true values are 
            known.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is Accuracy?</h4>
            <p>It simply measures how often the classifier correctly predicts. We can 
            define accuracy as the ratio of the number of correct predictions and the total 
            number of predictions.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is Precision?</h4>
            <p>Precision for a label is defined as the number of true positives divided by 
            the number of predicted positives.<br>Precision = TP/(TP+FP)</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is Recall/Sensitivity?</h4>
            <p>Recall/Sensitivity for a label is defined as the number of true positives 
            divided by the total number of actual positives.<br>Recall = TP/(TP+FN)</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is Specificity?</h4>
            <p>Specificity tells us what proportion of the negative class got correctly 
            classified.<br>Specificity = TN/(TN + FP)</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is F1 Score?</h4>
            <p>F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is maximum when 
            Precision is equal to Recall.<br>F1 Score = 2*(Precision*Recall)/
            (Precision+Recall)</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is the AUC ROC curve?</h4>
            <p>AUC ROC stands for 'Area Under the Curve' of the 'Receiver Operating 
            Characteristic' curve. The AUC ROC curve is basically a way of measuring the 
            performance of an ML model. AUC measures the ability of a binary classifier to 
            distinguish between classes and is used as a summary of the ROC curve.<br><br>The 
            ROC AUC score tells us how efficient the model is. The higher the AUC, the better 
            the model's performance at distinguishing between the positive and negative 
            classes. An AUC score of 1 means the classifier can perfectly distinguish between 
            all the Positive and the Negative class points. An AUC value of 0 shows that the 
            classifier predicts all Negatives as Positives and vice versa.</p>
