    <h1>Machine Learning Question and Answers</h1>
    <div>
      <h4>What is Machine Learning?</h4>
      <p>Machine learning is an subset of AI that enables machine to learn and improve from
        experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing
        programming logic that can access data and use it to learn for themselves by focuses on
        analyzing and interpreting patterns and structures in data to enable learning, reasoning,
        and decision making which can't be done by human interaction.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Types of Machine Learning?</h4>
      <p>* Supervised Learning<br>* Unsupervised Learning<br>* Reinforcement Learning</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is Supervised Learning?</h4>
      <p>Supervised machine learning learns patterns and relationships between input and output
        data. It is defined by its use of labeled data. A labeled data is a dataset that contains
        a lot of examples of Features and Target. Supervised learning uses algorithms that learn
        the relationship of Features and Target from the dataset.</p>
      <p>Supervised learning further falls into two groups:</p>
      <p>* Regression<br>* Classification</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is Unsupervised Learning?</h4>
      <p>Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised
        using training dataset. Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from
        the given data. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the human brain while
        learning new things.<br>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which
        models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without
        any supervision.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is Reinforcement Learning?</h4>
      <p>Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent
        learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of
        actions. For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action,
        the agent gets negative feedback or penalty.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>How Supervised Learning works?</h4>
      <p> * The Machine Learning algorithm here is provided with a small training dataset to work
        with, which is a smaller part of the bigger dataset.<br>
        * It serves to give the algorithm an idea of the problem, solution, and various data points
        to be dealt with.<br>
        * The training dataset here is also very similar to the final dataset in its characteristics
        and offers the algorithm with the labeled parameters required for the problem.<br>
        * The Machine Learning algorithm then finds relationships between the given parameters,
        establishing a cause and effect relationship between the variables in the dataset</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>How Unsupervised Learning works?</h4>
      <p> * Since unsupervised learning does not have any labels to work off, it creates hidden
        structures.<br>
        * Relationships between data points are then perceived by the algorithm randomly or
        abstractly, with absolutely no input required from human beings.<br>
        * Instead of a specific, defined, and set problem statement, unsupervised learning
        algorithms can adapt to the data by changing hidden structures dynamically.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>How Reinforcement Learning works?</h4>
      <p> * Reinforcement learning features a machine learning algorithm that improves upon itself.<br>
        * It typically learns by trial and error to achieve a clear objective.<br>
        * In this Machine Learning algorithm, favorable outputs are reinforced or encouraged,
        whereas non-favorable outputs are discouraged.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Problems solved by ML?</h4>
      <p>* Identifying Spam<br> * Forecasting<br> * Customer Segmentation<br>
        * Image & Video Recognition<br> * Fraudulent Transactions<br> * Demand Forecasting<br>
        * Virtual Personal Assistant<br> * Sentiment Analysis<br> * Making Product Recommendations</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?</h4>
      <p>The difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear
        regression output is the continuous value that can be anything while logistic
        regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or
        not.<br><br>Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems, whereas
        Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is R-squared score?</h4>
      <p>R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the
        variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable in a
        regression model.<br>* If R^2 is 1, then our regression line connects all points.
        <br> * If R^2 is 0, then our regression line not connected with any points and
        error are high. <br>* Good fitness of R^2 values should be above 0.6
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Probability vs Odds:</h4>
      <p>Probability mean success / total attempt.<br>Odds mean success / failed.<br>
        <b>Eg.</b> In summer day, catching 2 fishes in 5 days. in winter day, catching
        3 fishes in 5 days.<br>
        * prob = 2/5 in summer, prob = 3/5 in winter.<br>
        * odds = 2/3 in summer, odds = 3/2 in winter.<br>

      <h4>Evaluation Metrics for Regression: </h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSE<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RMSE</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is Mean Squared Error(MSE)?</h4>
      <p>The MSE is calculated as the mean or average of the squared differences
        between predicted and expected target values in a dataset.<br>It is also an
        important loss function for algorithms fit or optimized using the least squares
        framing of a regression problem.<br>we perform squared to avoid the cancellation
        of negative terms and it is the benefit of MSE.</p>
      <p><b>Advantages:</b><br>* The graph of MSE is differentiable, so you can easily
        use it as a loss function.</p>
      <p><b>Disadvantages:</b><br>* The value you get after calculating MSE is a squared unit
        of output. for example, the output variable is in meter(m) then after calculating
        MSE the output we get is in meter squared.<br>
        * If you have outliers in the dataset then it penalizes the outliers most and the
        calculated MSE is bigger. So, in short, It is not Robust to outliers which were
        an advantage in MAE.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)?</h4>
      <p>* It is square of RME.<br>* The square root of the error is calculated, which means that the units of the
        RMSE are the same as the original units of the target value that is being
        predicted.<br>* A perfect RMSE value is 0.0, which means that all predictions
        matched the expected values exactly.<br>
        <b>Advantage: </b>The output value you get is in the same unit as the required
        output variable which makes interpretation of loss easy.<br>
        <b>Disadvantage: </b>It is not that robust to outliers as compared to MAE.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is Mean Absolute Error(MAE)?</h4>
      <p>MAE is a very simple metric which calculates the absolute difference between
        actual and predicted values.<br><b>Advantage: </b><br>* The MAE you get is in the same
        unit as the output variable.<br>
        * It is most Robust to outliers.<br>
        <b>Disadvantage:</b> The graph of MAE is not differentiable so we have to apply
        various optimizers like Gradient descent which can be differentiable.

      <h4>What is Confusion Matrix?</h4>
      <p>Confusion Matrix is a performance measurement for the machine learning
        classification problems where the output can be two or more classes. It is a
        table with combinations of predicted and actual values.<br>A confusion matrix
        is defined as the table that is often used to describe the performance of a
        classification model on a set of the test data for which the true values are
        known.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is Accuracy?</h4>
      <p>It simply measures how often the classifier correctly predicts. We can

        Precision is equal to Recall.<br>F1 Score = 2*(Precision*Recall)/
        (Precision+Recall)</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is the AUC ROC curve?</h4>
      <p>AUC ROC stands for 'Area Under the Curve' of the 'Receiver Operating
        Characteristic' curve. The AUC ROC curve is basically a way of measuring the
        performance of an ML model. AUC measures the ability of a binary classifier to
        distinguish between classes and is used as a summary of the ROC curve.<br><br>The
        ROC AUC score tells us how efficient the model is. The higher the AUC, the better
        the model's performance at distinguishing between the positive and negative
        classes. An AUC score of 1 means the classifier can perfectly distinguish between
        all the Positive and the Negative class points. An AUC value of 0 shows that the
        classifier predicts all Negatives as Positives and vice versa.</p>

      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is a hyperparameter?</h4>
      <p>
        A hyperparameter is a parameter that is set before training begins and is

        strength, and number of hidden units in a neural network.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?</h4>

        machine learning algorithms to implicitly transform the input data into a
        higher-dimensional feature space.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is a loss function?</h4>
      <p>
        A loss function is a function that measures the error or cost of a model's
        predictions relative to the true values. The goal of training a model is to
        minimize the loss function.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is a gradient descent?</h4>
      <p>
        Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss
        function by iteratively updating the model parameters in the direction of
        the negative gradient.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What is a learning rate?</h4>
      <p>
