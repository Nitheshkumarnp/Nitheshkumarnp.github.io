    <h4>What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?</h4>
    <p>
      A function is a block of code that can be called by its name and is executed
      when it is called. A method is a function that is associated with an object
      and can be called on that object.

      What is the difference between a module-level function and a class method in
      Python?
    </h4>

      A module-level function is a function that is defined at the module level
      and does not belong to any class. A class method is a method that is
      associated with a class and can be called on that class or on any instance
      of that class.

    <h4>What is a virtual environment in Python?</h4>
    <p>
      A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows for the
      installation of packages without interfering with other Python installations
      on the system. It is useful for managing dependencies and ensuring that code
      runs consistently across different systems.
