    <h4>What is Lasso regression?</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lasso regression, also known as L1 regularization, is
      a type of linear regression model used in machine learning that performs
      variable(feature) selection and regularization.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main idea behind lasso regression is to add
      a penalty term to the loss function of the linear regression model. This
      penalty term is a sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the
      model, multiplied by a regularization parameter alpha. The effect of
      this penalty term is to force some of the coefficients to be exactly
      zero, effectively performing variable selection and producing a sparse
      model.
    </p>
    <h4>When to use Lasso regression?</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lasso regression can be used in machine learning when
      you have a dataset with many features and you suspect that only a subset
      of those features are important for predicting the target variable. Here
      are some scenarios where lasso regression may be useful:

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Feature selection</b>: When you have a large
      number of features and you want to identify the most important ones for
      predicting the target variable, lasso regression can be used to select a
      subset of the features and set the coefficients of the others to zero.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Multicollinearity</b>: When you have highly
      correlated features, lasso regression can help to select one feature
      over the others, effectively reducing the multicollinearity in the
      model.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Interpretable models</b>: When you want a
      simple and interpretable model, lasso regression can help by selecting
      only a subset of the features that are most important for predicting the
      target variable.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sparse models</b>: When you want a model with
      fewer parameters and fewer degrees of freedom, lasso regression can help
      to produce a sparse model that only uses a subset of the available
      features.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Outlier detection</b>: Lasso regression can
      be more sensitive to outliers than other types of regularization, which
      may be useful in identifying potential outliers in the dataset.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's important to note that lasso regression may
      not be the best choice for every problem, and other types of
      regularization, such as ridge regression or elastic net, may be more
      appropriate in some cases. The choice of regularization technique will
      depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of
      the modeling task.
    </p>
    <h4>Why to use lasso regression?</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Feature selection</b>: Lasso regression is
      particularly useful when there are many features in the dataset, some of
      which may be irrelevant or redundant. By setting some of the
      coefficients to zero, lasso regression can help to identify the most
      important features for predicting the target variable, while ignoring
      the rest.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Regularization</b>: Lasso regression is a
      form of regularization, which can help to prevent overfitting of the
      model to the training data. Regularization can improve the
      generalization performance of the model by reducing the variance of the
      model.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sparsity</b>: Lasso regression tends to
      produce sparse models, where only a subset of the features are used in
      the model. Sparse models can be more interpretable and easier to
      understand than models that use all the available features.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Improved prediction accuracy</b>: Lasso
      regression can sometimes improve the prediction accuracy of the model by
      reducing the effects of irrelevant or redundant features, and by
      reducing overfitting.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Outlier detection</b>: Lasso regression can
      be more sensitive to outliers in the data than other types of
      regularization, which can be useful in identifying potential outliers in
      the dataset.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, lasso regression can be a powerful tool
      for feature selection, regularization, and improving the prediction
      accuracy of linear regression models in machine learning. However, it's
      important to choose the regularization parameter carefully and to tune
      it using cross-validation to avoid underfitting or overfitting the model
      to the data.
    </p>
    <h4>Assumptions:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Linearity</b>: Lasso regression assumes that the
      relationship between the independent variables and the dependent
      variable is linear. If this assumption is violated, the model may
      produce biased or inaccurate predictions.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Independence</b>: Lasso regression assumes
      that the observations in the dataset are independent of each other. If
      there is correlation between the observations, the model may be biased
      or produce inaccurate predictions.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Homoscedasticity</b>: Lasso regression
      assumes that the variance of the residuals is constant across all levels
      of the independent variables. If the variance of the residuals is not
      constant, the model may produce biased or inaccurate predictions.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Normality</b>: Lasso regression assumes that
      the residuals (the differences between the predicted values and the
      actual values) are normally distributed. If the residuals are not
      normally distributed, the model may not be optimal.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Multicollinearity</b>: Lasso regression
      assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with
      each other. If there is multicollinearity, the model may be biased or
      produce inaccurate predictions.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's important to check these assumptions before
      applying lasso regression to a dataset, and to take appropriate steps to
      address any violations of the assumptions. For example, if there is
      multicollinearity, you may need to remove or combine some of the
      correlated features. If the residuals are not normally distributed, you
      may need to apply a transformation to the data.
    </p>
    <h4>Advantages:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Feature selection</b>: Lasso regression can help to
      identify the most important features for predicting the target variable,
      while ignoring the rest. This can be useful when there are many features
      in the dataset, some of which may be irrelevant or redundant.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Regularization</b>: Lasso regression is a
      form of regularization, which can help to prevent overfitting of the
      model to the training data. Regularization can improve the
      generalization performance of the model by reducing the variance of the
      model.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sparsity</b>: Lasso regression tends to
      produce sparse models, where only a subset of the features are used in
      the model. Sparse models can be more interpretable and easier to
      understand than models that use all the available features.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Outlier detection</b>: Lasso regression can
      be more sensitive to outliers in the data than other types of
      regularization, which can be useful in identifying potential outliers in
      the dataset.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Improved prediction accuracy</b>: Lasso
      regression can sometimes improve the prediction accuracy of the model by
      reducing the effects of irrelevant or redundant features, and by
      reducing overfitting.
    </p>
    <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bias</b>: Lasso regression tends to produce biased
      estimates of the coefficients, particularly when the number of features
      is large relative to the sample size. This can lead to inaccurate
      predictions.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Model instability</b>: Lasso regression can
      be sensitive to small changes in the dataset, which can result in large
      changes in the estimated coefficients. This can make the model unstable
      and difficult to interpret.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assumptions</b>: Lasso regression makes many
      of the same assumptions as linear regression, such as linearity,
      normality, and independence. If these assumptions are violated, the
      model may produce biased or inaccurate predictions.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Selection bias</b>: Lasso regression can lead
      to selection bias if the subset of features selected by the model is not
      representative of the true underlying relationship between the features
      and the target variable.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Difficulty in choosing regularization parameter</b>: Lasso regression requires the
      choice of a regularization parameter,
      which determines the amount of regularization applied to the model.
      Choosing the right value for this parameter can be difficult, and can
      require cross-validation or other methods to tune the parameter.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, lasso regression can be a powerful tool
      for feature selection, regularization, and improving the prediction
      accuracy of linear regression models in machine learning. However, it's
      important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the method
      before applying it to a particular problem, and to choose the
      regularization parameter carefully to avoid underfitting or overfitting
      the model to the data.
    </p>
    <h4>How lasso regression algorithms works?</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lasso regression works by adding a penalty term to the
      linear regression model, which encourages the model to select a smaller
      subset of features for the final model. The penalty term is based on the
      sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the features, and is
      multiplied by a regularization parameter λ.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective function for lasso regression is:

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minimize: RSS + λ * ||β||_1

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where RSS is the residual sum of squares,
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||β||_1 is the L1-norm of the coefficient vector
      β, and λ is the regularization parameter.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The L1-norm of the coefficient vector β is the
      sum of the absolute values of the coefficients:

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||β||_1 = |β_1| + |β_2| + ... + |β_p|

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where p is the number of features in the
      dataset.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty term encourages the model to set
      some of the coefficients to zero, effectively removing the corresponding
      features from the model. This results in a sparse model, where only a
      subset of the features are used for prediction.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve the optimization problem, various
      algorithms can be used, such as coordinate descent or the least angle
      regression (LARS) algorithm.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, the regularization parameter λ
      needs to be chosen carefully, as it controls the amount of sparsity in
      the model. If λ is too small, the model may include too many features,
      while if λ is too large, the model may be too simple and underfit the
      data.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, lasso regression can be a powerful tool
      for feature selection and regularization, and can help to improve the
      prediction accuracy of linear regression models in machine learning.

    <h4>Evaluation Metrics:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</b>: This metric measures
      the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values
      of the target variable. Lower values of MSE indicate better prediction
      accuracy.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>R-squared (R^2)</b>: This metric measures the
      proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the
      model. Higher values of R-squared indicate better prediction accuracy.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</b>: This
      metric is the square root of the mean squared error and is expressed in
      the same units as the target variable. Lower values of RMSE indicate
      better prediction accuracy.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</b>: This metric
      measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and
      actual values of the target variable. Lower values of MAE indicate
      better prediction accuracy.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)</b>: This
      metric is a measure of the relative quality of a statistical model for a
      given set of data. Lower values of AIC indicate better model quality.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)</b>:
      This metric is a similar to AIC, but it includes a penalty term for the
      number of model parameters. Lower values of BIC indicate better model
      quality.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's important to note that the choice of
      evaluation metric depends on the specific problem and the nature of the
      target variable. For example, for a binary classification problem,
      metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score may be more
      appropriate than MSE or R-squared. Additionally, cross-validation can be
      used to evaluate the performance of lasso regression models on multiple
      folds of the data, and to estimate the generalization performance of the
      model.
