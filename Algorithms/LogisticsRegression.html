    <h4>What is logistic regression?</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning
      algorithm mainly used for classification problems where the goal is to
      predict the probability that an instance of belonging to a given
      class.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's referred to as regression because it
      takes the output of the linear regression function as input and uses a
      sigmoid function to estimate the probability for the given class.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logistic regression works by modeling the
      log-odds of the output variable, which is also known as the logit
      function. The logit function takes any real value and maps it to a value
      between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of the
      output variable being 1. The logistic regression model estimates the
      coefficients of the input variables, which indicate the strength and
      direction of the relationship between the input variables and the output
      variable.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logistic regression is widely used in various
      fields such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and social sciences for
      predicting the probability of a certain outcome. It is a simple and
      effective algorithm for binary classification problems and can be easily
      extended to multi-class classification problems.
    </p>
    <h4>Useful Terms</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Odds:</b> It is the ratio of something occurring to
      something not occurring. it is different from probability as probability
      is the ratio of something occurring to everything that could possibly
      occur.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Log-odds:</b> The log-odds, also known as the logit
      function, is the natural logarithm of the odds. In logistic regression,
      the log odds of the dependent variable are modeled as a linear
      combination of the independent variables and the intercept.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Coefficient:</b> The logistic regression model's
      estimated parameters, show how the independent and dependent variables
      relate to one another.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Intercept:</b> A constant term in the logistic
      regression model, which represents the log odds when all independent
      variables are equal to zero.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Maximum likelihood estimation:</b> The method used
      to estimate the coefficients of the logistic regression model, which
      maximizes the likelihood of observing the data given the model.
    </p>
    <h4>When to use logistic regression?</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Binary classification problems</b>: Logistic
      regression is a good choice when you have a binary classification
      problem, where you need to classify data into two categories such as yes
      or no, pass or fail, and so on.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Predicting probabilities</b>: Logistic
      regression is used when you need to predict probabilities of the binary
      outcome variable based on a set of predictor variables. This is
      especially useful when you need to estimate the likelihood of an event
      happening.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Linearly separable data</b>: Logistic
      regression is a good choice when the data is linearly separable, which
      means that there is a clear linear boundary between the two classes of
      data.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Small to medium-sized datasets</b>: Logistic
      regression is computationally efficient and can handle small to
      medium-sized datasets with a moderate number of predictor variables.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Interpretable results</b>: Logistic
      regression provides interpretable results as the coefficients of the
      input variables can be used to determine the impact of each variable on
      the outcome. This is useful for gaining insights into the relationship
      between the input variables and the outcome.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Benchmark model</b>: Logistic regression can
      serve as a benchmark model for evaluating the performance of other
      classification algorithms.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, logistic regression may not be suitable
      for complex classification problems where the decision boundary is
      nonlinear or where there are multiple classes. In these situations,
      other machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random
      forests, or neural networks may be more appropriate.
    </p>
    <h4>Why to use logistic regression?</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Simple and efficient</b>: Logistic regression is a
      simple and efficient algorithm that is easy to implement and interpret.
      It is computationally efficient and can handle small to medium-sized
      datasets.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Linear decision boundary</b>: Logistic
      regression models the probability of the outcome variable using a linear
      function of the input variables, which leads to a linear decision
      boundary. This makes it easy to understand and visualize the
      relationship between the input variables and the outcome.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Probabilistic output</b>: Logistic regression
      models the probability of the outcome variable, which makes it useful
      for predicting the likelihood of an event happening. It can be used to
      estimate the probability of a customer buying a product, the likelihood
      of a patient having a disease, or the probability of a loan being
      repaid.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Interpretable results</b>: The coefficients
      of the input variables in logistic regression models can be used to
      determine the impact of each variable on the outcome. This makes it
      useful for gaining insights into the relationship between the input
      variables and the outcome.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Regularization</b>: Logistic regression can
      be regularized to avoid overfitting and improve generalization
      performance. Regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization
      can be used to prevent the model from fitting noise in the data.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Benchmark model</b>: Logistic regression can
      serve as a benchmark model for evaluating the performance of other
      classification algorithms. It is a good starting point for
      classification problems and can help identify the most important
      features for predicting the outcome.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, logistic regression is a versatile
      algorithm that is suitable for a wide range of binary classification
      problems. Its simplicity and interpretability make it a popular choice
      in various fields such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and social
      sciences.

    <h4>Types:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Binary logistic regression</b>: Binary logistic
      regression is the most basic type of logistic regression, which is used
      when the output variable has only two possible values (e.g., 0 or 1, yes
      or no). This type of logistic regression models the probability of the
      output variable being 1 as a function of the input variables.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Multinomial logistic regression</b>:
      Multinomial logistic regression is used when the output variable has
      more than two possible values, but the values are not ordered. This type
      of logistic regression models the probability of each value of the
      output variable as a function of the input variables.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ordinal logistic regression</b>: Ordinal
      logistic regression is used when the output variable has more than two
      possible values, and the values are ordered (e.g., low, medium, high).
      This type of logistic regression models the cumulative probability of
      the output variable being less than or equal to each value as a function
      of the input variables.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Regularized logistic regression</b>:
      Regularized logistic regression is used to prevent overfitting and
      improve generalization performance. Regularization techniques such as L1
      and L2 regularization can be applied to logistic regression to control
      the magnitude of the coefficients of the input variables.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bayesian logistic regression</b>: Bayesian
      logistic regression is a probabilistic approach to logistic regression
      that uses Bayes' theorem to estimate the posterior distribution of the
      coefficients of the input variables. This allows for uncertainty
      quantification and model selection.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each type of logistic regression has its own
      strengths and weaknesses and is suitable for different types of
      classification problems. It is important to choose the appropriate type
      of logistic regression based on the nature of the problem and the
      characteristics of the data.
    </p>
    <h4>Assumption of logistic regression:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Binary outcome</b>: Logistic regression assumes
      that the outcome variable is binary, meaning that it can take on only
      two values (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no).

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Linearity</b>: Logistic regression assumes
      that the relationship between the input variables and the log odds of
      the outcome variable is linear.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Independence</b>: Logistic regression assumes
      that the observations are independent of each other. This means that the
      value of the outcome variable for one observation should not influence
      the value of the outcome variable for another observation.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>No multicollinearity</b>: Logistic regression
      assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity among the input
      variables. This means that the input variables should not be highly
      correlated with each other.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Large sample size</b>: Logistic regression
      assumes that the sample size is large enough to estimate the
      coefficients of the input variables accurately. A common rule of thumb
      is that there should be at least 10 observations for each input
      variable.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>No outliers</b>: Logistic regression assumes
      that there are no outliers in the data that can significantly affect the
      results.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Correctly specified model</b>: Logistic
      regression assumes that the model is correctly specified and that all
      relevant input variables are included in the model.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violations of these assumptions can lead to
      biased or inefficient estimates of the coefficients and inaccurate
      predictions. Therefore, it is important to check the assumptions of
      logistic regression before applying the model to the data.
    </p>
    <h4>Advantages:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Simple and efficient</b>: Logistic regression is a
      simple and efficient algorithm that is easy to implement and interpret.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Interpretable results</b>: The coefficients
      of the input variables in logistic regression models can be used to
      determine the impact of each variable on the outcome. This makes it
      useful for gaining insights into the relationship between the input
      variables and the outcome.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Probabilistic output</b>: Logistic regression
      models the probability of the outcome variable, which makes it useful
      for predicting the likelihood of an event happening.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Regularization</b>: Logistic regression can
      be regularized to avoid overfitting and improve generalization
      performance.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Good for binary classification problems</b>:
      Logistic regression is well suited for binary classification problems
      where the outcome variable has only two possible values.
    </p>
    <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Limited to linear decision boundaries</b>: Logistic
      regression models the probability of the outcome variable using a linear
      function of the input variables, which leads to a linear decision
      boundary. This makes it less suitable for problems where the decision
      boundary is nonlinear.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sensitive to outliers</b>: Logistic
      regression is sensitive to outliers in the data, which can significantly
      affect the results.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assumes independence of observations</b>:
      Logistic regression assumes that the observations are independent of
      each other, which may not be true in some cases.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Limited to categorical and numerical input variables</b>: Logistic regression is
      limited to handling categorical and numerical
      input variables and cannot handle text or image data directly.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Limited to binary outcome variables</b>:
      Logistic regression is limited to handling binary outcome variables and
      cannot handle multi-class outcomes without modification.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, logistic regression is a useful
      algorithm for binary classification problems where the decision boundary
      is linear, and the input variables are either categorical or numerical.
      However, it may not be suitable for problems where the decision boundary
      is nonlinear or the input variables are not well suited for linear
      modeling.
    </p>
    <h4>How logistic regression algorithm works?</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Data preprocessing</b>: The input data is first
      preprocessed to ensure that it is in the correct format for logistic
      regression. This may involve scaling the input variables or encoding
      categorical variables.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Model specification</b>: The logistic
      regression model is specified by defining the mathematical relationship
      between the input variables and the probability of the outcome variable.
      This relationship is typically modeled using a sigmoid function, which
      maps the input variables to a probability value between 0 and 1.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Model training</b>: The logistic regression
      model is trained using a dataset that contains the input variables and
      the corresponding values of the outcome variable. The goal of training
      is to find the optimal values of the model parameters (i.e., the
      coefficients of the input variables) that maximize the likelihood of the
      observed data.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Model evaluation</b>: The trained logistic
      regression model is evaluated using a separate dataset that was not used
      for training. The performance of the model is typically measured using
      metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Model prediction</b>: Once the logistic
      regression model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to make
      predictions on new data. Given a set of input variables, the model
      computes the probability of the outcome variable using the learned
      coefficients and the sigmoid function. The output is typically
      interpreted as the probability of the positive class (e.g., 1) given the
      input variables.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, logistic regression is a simple yet
      powerful algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome
      variable based on one or more input variables. The algorithm is widely
      used in classification problems where the goal is to predict whether an
      observation belongs to a certain class or not.
    </p>
    <h4>Evaluation metrics:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Accuracy</b>: Accuracy is the proportion of
      correctly classified observations out of the total number of
      observations. It is a simple and intuitive metric that is often used to
      evaluate classification models. However, accuracy can be misleading when
      the classes are imbalanced.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Precision</b>: Precision is the proportion of
      true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. It measures
      how well the model is able to correctly identify positive cases.
      Precision is useful when the cost of a false positive is high.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Recall</b>: Recall is the proportion of true
      positive predictions out of all actual positive cases. It measures how
      well the model is able to capture positive cases. Recall is useful when
      the cost of a false negative is high.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>F1 score</b>: F1 score is the harmonic mean
      of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both
      precision and recall. F1 score is useful when the classes are
      imbalanced.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ROC curve and AUC</b>: ROC (Receiver
      Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the
      performance of a binary classifier as the discrimination threshold is
      varied. AUC (Area Under the Curve) is the area under the ROC curve and
      provides a single metric that summarizes the overall performance of the
      classifier.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Confusion matrix</b>: A confusion matrix is a
      table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It
      shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and
      false negatives. From the confusion matrix, various evaluation metrics
      such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be computed.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, there are several evaluation metrics
      that can be used to assess the performance of a logistic regression
      model. The choice of metric depends on the specific problem and the
      relative importance of different types of errors.
    </p>
    <h4>Maximum likelihood:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum likelihood is a statistical method used to
      estimate the parameters of a probability distribution based on observed
      data. The idea behind maximum likelihood is to find the values of the
      parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the advantages of maximum likelihood is
      that it produces unbiased estimates of the parameters under certain
      assumptions, such as i.i.d. observations and a correctly specified
      probability distribution. However, maximum likelihood can be sensitive
      to outliers and can be computationally intensive for complex models.
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a powerful and flexible method that can be
      used to estimate a wide range of probability distributions, including
      normal, exponential, binomial, and Poisson distributions.
    </p>
    <h4>Sigmoid function:</h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that
      maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logistic function has an S-shaped curve and
      is symmetric around x = 0.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sigmoid function is commonly used in
      logistic regression, a statistical method used to model the probability
      of an event occurring, given a set of input variables. In logistic
      regression, the sigmoid function is used to map the linear combination
      of the input variables and their coefficients to a probability between 0
      and 1. The coefficients of the input variables in the logistic
      regression model represent the effect of each variable on the outcome,
      and are estimated from a training dataset.

      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the sigmoid function is a versatile
      mathematical tool that has numerous applications in various fields,
      including machine learning, neuroscience, and physiology.
